It&#39;s comparable to Ho Yips located in the financial district on Liberty Street, with a few differences. I consider Ho Yips the best &#34;bootleg&#34;/ &#34;Americanized Chinese food restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. <br><br>The first huge difference is the amount of starch, sauce and grease in Yips&#39; platters. I&#39;ve ordered both the Chicken with Chinese Mushroom and Chicken with Black Bean Sauce from the front and both contained a large amount of sauce that I did not see from Ho Yips. Ho Yips daily specials were saucy, but it was mostly contained within the ingredients of the special. Yips&#39; daily specials had sauce seeping into the white rice and making it down to the bottom of the container. All of the rice that was in my platter was drowned in sauce. Honestly I prefer it like that, but I know some people don&#39;t like their rice moistened. <br><br>A few smaller differences were that their containers were not plastic, but tin foil instead. Small gripe in that I prefer the plastic tupperwares just so that nothing spills. Finally, Yips&#39; is actually still holding at $5 for a majority of their daily specials with white rice ($5.25 with pork fried rice), while Ho Yips has raised their prices a bit every few months to now $5.60 for most of their daily specials.

So I figure I should give a favorite spot a review. \u00a0By far, I ate here the most frequently, I&#39;d say about once or twice a month on average, which, shockingly, puts me somewhere around 100 visits. \u00a0I&#39;m not proud of it, but stating it for purposes of this review.<br><br>There&#39;s two levels, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read about. \u00a0One buffet by weight section and one that, I&#39;ve never seen before, has already cooked options where they slap it together in seconds for you. \u00a0Their bread and butter is the lunch rush and they know it, get as many customers served as possible in that small window. \u00a0Works great for everyone.<br><br>I remember the first time I tried this place, I ordered over the phone, thinking it was like any other Chinese take out place. \u00a0Call ahead and pick it up right? \u00a0I go to pick it up and I was completely confused. \u00a0So I told them what I ordered and they made it right there. \u00a0That was a new experience for me. \u00a0It certainly works for everyone that way: faster service and higher turnover, no call-aheads or missing orders. \u00a0Go and get it, quickly.<br><br>I do the buffet more often, probably 4:1. \u00a0So I&#39;ll do that first. \u00a0The buffet is bountiful before 1pm. \u00a0Then they stop adding stuff and only add the bare necessities until the 1:45pm price drop, obviously to get rid of the stock. \u00a0Makes sense. \u00a0Price has gone up over time, but not by much, but the worst thing they did was get rid of the free drink if you hit a certain amount of weight! \u00a0Real bummer, but I&#39;m not going to take a star away for that. \u00a0That&#39;s a business move, I get it. \u00a0<br><br>My favorite buffet configuration, and I&#39;ll add a pic sometime, has some lo mein, some rice. \u00a0Scurry over to the Garlic Chicken (used to be in the front but now allllll the way in the back). \u00a0Now, the Garlic Chicken in the buffet is dark meat, but upstairs it&#39;s white meat. \u00a0So I take a little of the dark but what I really get a hold of is the salty garlic crunchies on the bottom and top the rice and lo mein with it. \u00a0Banging. \u00a0The string beans are perfectly cooked every single time, get them. \u00a0The other half of the container is a wild card, reserved for when they have the sporadic items, like: chicken and zucchini in black bean sauce or the chicken with peanuts. \u00a0<br><br>Overall, I love it. \u00a0It&#39;s great for what it is.<br><br>I&#39;m doing review based on the fact that this is a Chinese take out spot for lunch. \u00a0I&#39;m not going to compare it to Chinese restaurants, I feel there&#39;s a difference. \u00a0You don&#39;t take your date here, but you definitely go with a co-worker during lunch. \u00a0I don&#39;t know what to tell you if it&#39;s a lunch date? \u00a0Maybe?<br><br>If you do upstairs, stay away from the tall string bean, he&#39;s all rice and lo mein, and not a lot of what you really wanted. \u00a0The two guys that have been there as long as I been going there are the two you want. One has glasses and usually mans the left side of the counter, he will do it right with proper amounts of what you order. \u00a0The other OG rarely does food and seems to be managing a little more. <br><br>Everything I ate here was good, I love and miss this place immensely. \u00a0It&#39;s funny that when I go visit, of all the places to eat in NYC, that I&#39;ll pick this Chinese lunch spot.

It&#39;s a &#39;mixed&#39; experience.<br><br>Yes, the chicken I had was slightly rubbery and slightly chewy; but it was also very tender. It masticates very easily, by that I mean it is very soft, almost limp as it dissolves in your mouth. Not sure whether I like this or not. <br><br>There was some hint of pleasant flavor but nothing to make me leap out of my chair. I doubt the chicken were marinated in any creative or elaborate manner. They were acceptable/adequate for what they were purported to be, I suppose. Best tenders I might ever eat in this life? No, I can&#39;t quite see how that claim could ever be true.<br><br>Price: a bit steep for the size of the meal, ($13); you can wolf the meat down in just a few bites and no, it was not very filling. The toppings like lettuce/tomato/pickle were all rather half-hearted and average. <br><br>Fries were okay; but again--nothing very special or exciting. The much-touted &#34;&#39;76 sauce&#34;: eh, helpful in places where the generally moist chicken ran dry in spots. Like a slightly spicy Thousand-Island recipe you can make at home.<br><br>Something more disturbing to me (upon reflection) is the patriotic paint scheme, marketing, logo, and symbology of the company and the truck.

If it&#39;s not the hanging roast duck or bbq pork in the windows that hook most onlookers, it&#39;s the guarantee of knowing that the Canto game is alive and well is enough for me to step in.<br><br>The staff works hard and the place is pretty busy on the weekends. The seating will feel tight with the low ceilings and cramped round tables, but small groups will tend to do well here. Most of the wait staff speaks Canto and cash is generally preferred.<br><br>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure much of anything stands out here food wise. I&#39;ve had my share of their bbq meats (roast duck, bbq pork, siu yuk roast pig, etc.) and it was all decent. The same goes for their seafood, I think their steamed fish and ginger scallion lobster is also solid. The other dishes are somewhere in the middle, from their yee stir fried noodles to the yeung chow fried rice. I haven&#39;t found a super memorable dish, but I&#39;m definitely open to trying more.<br><br>I&#39;m hoping in time that things change for the better. The bathrooms aren&#39;t all that fabulous and the food while decent overall, could always use a bit of improvement.

However, my recent encounter with their chicken onigiri left much to be desired. This Yelp review aims to shed light on my experience, highlighting the shortcomings of this particular dish and expressing my disappointment with Yaya Tea&#39;s offering.<br><br>1. Presentation:<br>Upon receiving the chicken onigiri at Yaya Tea, I couldn&#39;t help but feel underwhelmed by its lackluster presentation. The onigiri, a traditional Japanese rice ball, should be visually enticing and appetizing. However, the one I received appeared rather plain and uninviting. Its shape seemed inconsistent, lacking the customary neat and tightly formed appearance expected from an authentic onigiri.<br><br>2. Texture:<br>As I took my first bite, I noticed an immediate issue with the texture. The rice was disappointingly dry and lacked the necessary stickiness and cohesion that is characteristic of a well-prepared onigiri. This flaw greatly diminished the overall enjoyment of the dish, making it feel like a lackluster culinary experience.<br><br>3. Flavor:<br>One of the most essential aspects of any dish is its flavor profile. Unfortunately, the chicken filling in the onigiri was remarkably bland. It lacked seasoning and failed to deliver any notable taste beyond the plainness of the rice. The absence of complementary flavors or spices made the overall dish monotonous and unexciting. Given Yaya Tea&#39;s reputation for flavor experimentation, this lack of creativity was especially disappointing.<br><br>4. Ingredient Quality:<br>Another aspect worth mentioning is the quality of the ingredients used. The chicken in the onigiri was subpar, lacking the tenderness and succulence that would have elevated the overall experience. It appeared as if the chicken had been prepared without any marination or additional flavoring, resulting in a dish that felt devoid of any culinary expertise or attention to detail.<br><br>5. Price and Value:<br>Considering the price I paid for the chicken onigiri at Yaya Tea, the lack of quality and flavor made it a poor value for money. I expected a more satisfying and enjoyable experience given the establishment&#39;s reputation and the prices they charge for their offerings. Unfortunately, this particular dish fell short of meeting those expectations, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and disheartened.<br><br>In conclusion, my experience with Yaya Tea&#39;s chicken onigiri was disappointing, to say the least. From its unimpressive presentation and dry texture to its lackluster flavor and subpar ingredient quality, this dish failed to meet the standards one would expect from a reputable eatery. While Yaya Tea&#39;s beverage selection remains noteworthy, their execution of the chicken onigiri leaves much to be desired. As a customer seeking an enjoyable culinary adventure, I hope Yaya Tea takes this feedback constructively and works to improve the quality and taste of their food offerings, ensuring a more satisfying experience for all patrons.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 71, "reviewCount": 62, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "12/7/2022", "comment": {"text": "- yakisoba is the best dish here hands down.

I was looking for something somewhat &#34;authentic&#34; but without the shock that many authentic dishes come with (like jellyfish, fish heads, pig intestine, duck tongues, etc.) I know of a few good restaurants on the Mott Street side of Chinatown (Wo Hop for one), but the East Broadway side is much more adventurous, mainly because there is almost no English spoken or written here. The first restaurant I walked into was Yung Sun, drawn in by their take-out menus printed in English (most restaurants on East Broadway DO NOT offer English menus.) I&#39;m glad I chose Yung Sun, because it turned out to be so good, I ate here 4 nights in a row. Almost all of the dishes I ordered were delicious. Some were a little oily, but nothing unexpected. Only the Foo Chow wonton soup was inedible; the broth was salty and tasteless, the wontons are not the ones you&#39;re used to either. Not very good. But, the lychee pork, black pepper chicken with mixed vegetables, pork with Chinese vegetables, chicken &amp; baby shrimp with mixed vegetables, taro cake, and hot &amp; sour soup were all superb. In fact, the H&amp;S soup was the best I have ever tasted. Other dishes that were sampled; chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce, beef chow fun (too much gravy), salt &amp; pepper squid, orange flavor beef, chicken &amp; vegetables in garlic sauce, and pork dumplings. I found that the dishes served &#34;Chinese style&#34; (over rice) were an awesome deal (albeit with less choices than the rest of the menu) at about $4.50 each dish. The taro cake is a must (and it&#39;s only $.70.) The reason I didn&#39;t give Yung Sun a rating of 5 is because the people working here have no personality and speak NO English. I originally tried to phone in my order, only to be told &#34;no speak English.&#34; Even in the restaurant, I had to circle numbers on the menu, no other interaction. And, you would think after giving them business for four nights in a row they would become somewhat friendly. Not these folks. The restaurant itself is very clean for Chinatown. Prices are excellent, and the food is superb. I want to tell them how good their food is, but they wouldn&#39;t understand!

With Yoshida-san at the helm, Yoshino is arguably the only sushi restaurant in New York run by a sushi master rather than an apprentice or budding chef. The high price, critical acclaim, and difficulty in securing a reservation create extremely elevated expectations that Yoshino meets, but doesn&#39;t exceed. For me, Yoshino, though excellent, is a destination and not a place that will become my regular spot.<br><br>Yoshino opened in 2021 when Yoshida-san decided to embark on a new adventure and follow his dreams to bring his restaurant to New York. He prides himself on sharing traditional Japanese culture with the international community and features a menu laden with the highest quality seafood that he can source from Japan. Yoshida-san has a reputation among high-end sushi chefs in New York for serving the best tuna, often featuring Oma and Aomori hon-maguro during the meal.<br><br>On my first visit in February 2022, I loved the chef&#39;s ankimo preparation along with the sawara, chiaigishi, and otoro nigiri, the bafun uni gunkan maki, miso soup, and Sous Chef Gang&#39;s Basque cheesecake. This week&#39;s highlights included the ankimo and nodoguro egg yolk rice otsumami. The ko-aji and akami nigiri, miso soup, and uni torotaku handroll were also exceptional. For dessert, the white chocolate gelato was a standout. Across the visits, Chef Yoshida&#39;s ankimo has been stellar - creamy, luscious, rich, and slightly sweet. And this week&#39;s lightly grilled nodoguro exploded with liquid fat and flavor that coats your tongue and mouth. The finish was long, lingering for minutes afterward.<br><br>Yoshino successfully captures the &#39;New York Style&#39; dinner theater experience, a concept pioneered by Sushi Noz in 2018. From the hikarimono and tuna display to the sabazushi searing ceremony, Yoshida-san and Sous Chef Gang grab and hold the diners&#39; attention.<br><br>At times, Yoshino suffers from a lack of harmony. On my first visit, I was underwhelmed by the heavily French-influenced otsumami; one that still bothers me was a plastic bag filled with clams and tasteless shaved truffle. While the otsumami were significantly better on my second visit, the shiro amadai, kaki, kegani appetizer missed the mark even if the culinary techniques and presentation were high-class. Despite the hype, his signature dishes such as the saba pressed roll and karasumi mochi are not more delicious than his other offerings. In fact, the mochi was tasteless and slightly burnt with poor distribution of karasumi inside.<br><br>For aficionados and completionists, Yoshino is worth a visit. However, even at Yoshino, you will not find perfection. If perfection doesn&#39;t exist, then maybe we should look for something else.

However, being the most expensive sushi (and meals) I had had at $515 net, I expected nothing less than the best sushi in my life, and unfortunately it didn&#39;t deliver, by quite a large margin. There were things that I was impressed and a few things that let me down. Let me elaborate:<br><br>Things that impressed me: the technique and the texture - in my opinion, chef Yoshida&#39;s technique is number one. His nigiri was pressed into perfection. The amount of pressure he put onto the rice, making it firm to the touch, but still melt once it touches your tongue. The balance of topping and rice is impeccable. You might have had this experience where some chef did not get the amount of shari correctly, and you ended up chewing fish at the end of the piece while the rice already disappeared. Here, the rice and the fish were gone at the exact same time. And he managed to do this every single piece. This is truly a master at work.<br><br>Another point that really impressed me is the texture. Every piece is on point. The ankimo is cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth like a piece of Foie Gras. And I have never had a fried kinmedai as good as I had here.<br><br>However, here comes some minor disappointments. The fish, for some reason, did not quite show its flavor that day. The ebi was not quite as sweet as other places. The kohada, although was pickled really well, didn&#39;t taste very umami. The grilled saba, which was supposed to be the highlight of the night, did not have that lovely fattiness like when I had it at sushi Nakamura in Tokyo or Sushi Yoshizumi in San Meteo. The bafun uni was only average, although that&#39;s more about the luck of the draw rather than the skill of the chef.<br><br>Here comes the major disappointment: appetizer. To summarize, I think chef Yoshida tried to make appetizers that gear towards American audiences. I appreciate the effort, but the flavor combination just did not work well, and most of the time was more of a distraction from the ingredient itself. For instance, the fried kinmedai that was cooked to perfection, was drenched in a ginger scallion sweet soy sauce &#39;Chinese style&#39;. I would be more satisfied if it was served only with a pinch of salt, grated wasabi or daikon, and a wedge of sudachi, which will certainly highlight the excellent cooking of the fish. The hotaru ika was smoked with some kind of wood (apple I believe) that did not go quite well with the ika, and furthermore it was seasoned heavily with white miso dressing which completely hid the flavor of the squid itself. I&#39;d be completely satisfy if this was grilled lightly on binchotan charcoal with salt and served to me on a skewer. The worst dish of the night is certainly the salmon, which is covered in onion cream which taste like salad cream. It was sad that I didn&#39;t taste any salmon in that dish. <br><br>I didn&#39;t want to end this review in a bad note, so let me say that this is overall still an excellent meal.

Let me simply say, this meal was amazing and ethereal at times.<br><br>Yoshida-San is very friendly and will do his best to communicate with you in English. The menu had some nice touches with different techniques outside of the classic Edomae sushi courses. The initial appetizer was firefly squid with cauliflower pur\u00e9e and caviar. The sweet miso sauce binded all components of the dish and it was a luxurious, flavorful start to our omakase. Two of the appetizers were very similar to what we had at Sushi Sho (squid stuffed rice and ankimo) and were executed very well. We were served a very unique baby anago (noresore) in &#34;noodle&#34; form with a savory soup and tiny morsels of fried inari, which was quite delicious and different. We were also served a savory mochi (karasumi) which was stuffed with an in-house aged roe seared over charcoal; a very interesting texture (chewy like a thick mozzarella cheese with a stiffer gel-like texture from the air-aged roe) and very different from what we have ever had at an omakase establishment. The amadai (tilefish) dish was prepared inside a plastic bag encapsulating the aromatic fish and clam broth. Instead of being overpowered with salinity, the broth provided an intense flavor but light mouthfeel which was extracted from the two types of protein. The New Zealand king salmon dish with peeled cherry tomatoes was an excellent and unique dish as well. The tomatoes burst with their sweet juices while the salmon provided the familiar firm texture and fattiness as your bite progressed through the inside of your mouth.<br><br>The shari rice is made with 3 different types of vinegar and aggressively seasoned, just how I personally enjoy the shari when combined with the neta. The personal standout nigiri for me was the iwashi (sardine). The neta was scored incredibly intricately and had the perfect balance of flavor (slight sweetness from the fat), texture of the flesh, flavor of the shari, and the disbursement of the rice grains as the nigiri is pressed against the roof of your mouth with the initial bite. The bluefin tuna was top grade and two different types of otoro procured from Toyosu market that was first auction of best quality while the akami was from Boston. The two types of toro, kamashita and otoro had the familiar more firm texture of a wild bluefin tuna but finished with a nice melting of the fat which enveloped your tongue as you finished the bite. We were served a very unique lightly fried fugu milt (sperm sac) which continued the same velvety theme as the ankimo that was served earlier in the omakase. The Hokkaido uni used was of the very best premium quality as each gonad sliver was of the exact uniform color and size. Yoshida-San seemed most proud of his giant saba roll which was seared with a very hot charcoal grate. Again, very delicious.<br><br>The meal is very expensive (party of 2 was over $1,000 with tip, no alcohol) but if you have the money to burn, it is worth at least one try.

I thought it would be the perfect place to celebrate an 11th year anniversary. Sadly, it was memorable in all the wrong ways. Maybe it was bad luck but luck shouldn&#39;t matter for a restaurant of this caliber. <br><br>Arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes early and waited with a few other guests in a small foyer. We were soon greeted by the host and shown to our seats. We sat at the far end. The interior is what one would expect. Gorgeous counter, tasteful decor, and spacious yet intimate. We were promptly presented with the menu and beverage options. The waiter also pointed out the cloth napkin (&#34;a gift&#34;) that the chef designed himself. It was thoughtful and the design was unique but the fabric was far from ideal for napkin use (nit-picky). Regardless, we were excited for the food to come.<br><br>Then, things got ... interesting? Apparently, the day before was the chef&#39;s birthday and all the guests (expect me, my wife, and one other guest sitting next to me) were friends with the chef and sous chef. They came with gifts and champagne and desserts to celebrate. We didn&#39;t think much of it at first, in fact we enjoyed the celebratory vibe, or so we thought. But then the sous chef came out and the experience went south. The best way I can describe it is a king (chef) and a court jester (sous chef). As the chef was unwrapping his birthday gifts, the sous chef provided completely unnecessary comic relief. Photo bombing pictures, sarcastically demanding gifts, complimenting and comparing the value of the gifts, etc. This charade would continue the entire night. I understand that chef didn&#39;t speak Chinese and having a trilingual sous chef is invaluable. But rather than simply being the translator, the entire night was just gossip and small talk between the sous chef and the party guests. Even the chef at times stood there looking clueless as to what the conversation is about. <br><br>Let&#39;s talk about the food. There were 8 appetizers followed by 14 sushi. Most of the appetizer were misses for me and mostly for the same reasons. The preparations either did not let the ingredient shine or poorly composed. There was either an overshadowing sauce, a random overpowering ingredient or simply too much going on. The hairy crab, with caviar and uni, all delectable ingredients, ruined by half a green grape. The ikameshi was ok, very standard. The chawanmushi was loose and watery, bit on the salty side and served in the tubular cup with a thick wooden spoon. The ankimo was cold, fishy and had a denser texture than I&#39;m use to. The hotaruika and miso sauce was fine, but the garnish pepper leaf was a too much. The karasumi was the best appetizer. It was creative, but yet simple. The kinmedai preparation did not do it justice. It could&#39;ve been any snapper and it would&#39;ve tasted the same. And lastly, the salmon, drenched in a white sauce that tasted like bottled salad dressing. <br><br>During most of the appetizer course, which was prepared 90% by the sous chef, the chef paced behind him with a glass of wine, occasionally peeking over his shoulder. I&#39;ve been to my fair share of high end omakase and usually the chef handles most of the food presentation . Also, if the restaurant staff is reading this, word of advice, it is very off-putting the way the appetizers are assembled from cling wrap-covered plastic tubs from the under-counter refrigerators in front of the guests. It honestly feels like layering scoops of leftover, which could&#39;ve been easily avoid by doing it in the kitchen.<br><br>On to the sushi course. There&#39;s not too much to say, it&#39;s exactly what I expected. Starting with the oily-er fish, mackerel and gizzard shad. Both well salted and marinaded. The shad, maybe a touch too long in the vinegar, but still delicious. The striped jack and spanish mackerel paired beautifully with the seasoned rice. Temperature of the fish and rice were spot on. The hairy crab was good but I would have preferred not repeating it from the appetizer. Then followed the lean, medium and fatty tuna, which were all amazing. The nodoguro was a pleasant surprise and tasty. The remaining items were decent too. The meal ended with a Japanese musk melon, which was ok but clearly overrippened. Two of the diners brought cakes and were gracious to share with all the diners. <br><br>The night ended strangely as we asked for the check, paid and exited while the guests and chefs continued their festivities. Overall the dining &#34;experience&#34; I give it a 1/5. It might have been very different if we dined some other night or with a different crowd, but again, when diners are paying $500+, this is not acceptable.

I confirmed with restaurant and I was expect to attend. However I waked up in the morning and was shocked because the manger cancelled my reservation at middle night , the day of my reservation ,my anniversary ! \u00a0last minute the manger cancelled my reservation. I waited for their call, they didn&#39;t even give me a call! So I wrote a email to them ask the reason. They just say they define my credit card as scalper&#39;s ( that&#39;s their explanation which is absolutely insult, I can simply give them other credit card if they doubt, second how they still took my deposit actually two full meal fee 1000$+200$ service+tax \u00a0if they doubt my credit card ? but without any apology and without communicating with me!!! ( what is funny is , they charge the deposit already ! I don&#39;t know whether other people&#39;s reservation had been cancelled without refund like this ? \u00a0whole morning Totally no contact , no detail explanation . They didn&#39;t even give a call to explain. In the email , they asked me to contact with \u00a0Tock, but funny is Tock don&#39;t know anything, they check the system they don&#39;t the why they cancelled my reservation. Tock asked me to call the restaurant , but I called them. None picked phone at all. Moreover they already deposited with my credit! Tock said the deposit already transferred to restaurant! ( that&#39;s so wired , what &#39;s \u00a0their behavior ) . Around 1 pm afternoon already ( you know you suffered from this disgusting thing, you won&#39;t have mood to plan other thing). the first email they just said my credit card is scalper but without mentioning any refund, Yoshino asked me to contact Tock and didn&#39;t mention any refund. They are really susceptive. Until I said your restaurant sent the confirmation email ahead and cancelled my reservation after my confirming, and Tock don&#39;t know why your restaurant cancelled my reservation! ( luckily I contacted with Tock first , I could stop them using any excuses ) then they sent me second email promise me will refund it. But \u00a0how can they charge with my credit card already. They deposited already. Back step , They should cancel at least 3 days ahead. They knew the rules that if cancelled within 3 days , no refund. This is seriously problem. If they cancelled my reservation at least one week ahead , I wouldn&#39;t be so angry. In addition , I could have enough time to book other restaurant. This restaurant ruined my anniversary totally. \u00a0Make me feel disgusting. I feel huge depression , sadness. I think none met this situation like me. Anniversary cancelled by a restaurant and didn&#39;t receive any apology. The explanation email I only could tell how much rudeness and arrogant \u00a0of them, there is no single word of apology. Never meet this kind of restaurant before. The popularity is based on their fame from Nagoya ,they chose New York instead of Tokyo. Tokyo is more competitive. We travel to Japan always , my Japanese traveling argent helped us book many local Japanese restaurants. They are so polite never broke the agreement. This restaurant is no thing about food , they thought they are top star , and they are so popular and never lack of costumers. \u00a0So Disgusting.

Somewhere in between lies a grey area that challenges you to forget about everything you thought you knew about food. \u00a0Chef Yoshida-san not only shares his imagination, but also inspires you to open your mind over and over again. Nothing will compare to the mind-blowing experience emerging within Yoshino&#39;s walls. \u00a0Picture prom night but with two dates. \u00a0From the specific origin of each ingredient to the history of the Hinoki counter, every detail serves a greater purpose that ultimately redefines the meaning of beauty, balance, and art. \u00a0Special thanks to my close friends, Jerry &amp; Jessie, for finessing the opening weekend reservation. \u00a0Covid or not, this intimate dinner together was so special to me &amp; Margie.<br><br>Stepping into Yoshino felt more like stepping off the metro in downtown Tokyo. \u00a0With this type of ambiance, it&#39;s only fitting that I indulge in rare sake til I start to feel pleasantly jetlagged. \u00a0But rest assured, every bite will awaken your senses. \u00a0The intro to the omakase was uni/caviar/hairy crab. \u00a0Meticulously constructed in multiple layers, this masterpiece essentially builds anticipation.

Let&#39;s dive in...<br><br>Salad (3/5): The only item lacking a bit in this meal, the salad doesn&#39;t do anything original with this standard at most Japanese restaurants. The iceberg lettuce was still wet making it hard for the dressing to adhere well to the lettuce and carrot shavings. The dressing flavor was the usual carrot-ginger combo. <br><br>Bean Curd Avocado Roll (3/5): This is my first time trying this roll. Overall the roll flavor is a bit like a sweet-salty bread (the bean curd) and the avocado is fatty and creamy, so it&#39;s a lot of soft textures. I would consider it again but only with crunchy ingredients added (e.g., cucumber).<br><br>Mango Avocado Roll (Add Jalape\u00f1o) (4/5): Glad jalape\u00f1o was added to this. This checks the box for the most part as vegetarian rolls go. The mango was sweet enough for not being in season right now. <br><br>Shrimp Mango Avocado Roll (4/5): Very nice to have a 3-ingredient roll on a lunch special menu! I would personally like more equal proportions of shrimp and mango compared to the big hunk of avocado (but I&#39;m nit picky so take this comment as you please). Otherwise this is a nice combo of flavor. <br><br>Alaska Roll (5/5): Again, 3-ingredient rolls included in a lunch special makes the value-seeker in me giddy!

We had to mix in the raw egg yolk with the meatball and it tasted absolutely amazing. <br><br>I could not stop eating the Hotata Butter scallops, the butter mixture was so rich and flavorful, and the added lemon juice complemented the scallops and the sauce perfectly. The scallops were also extremely tender and flavorful, and they even put salt on the side to add an extra zing. The grilled squid was also extremely appetizing and delicious, and they gave an extremely generous amount of squid that was addicting to eat.<br><br>Lastly was the omakase-styled sushi part of the dinner. They gave us generous amounts of fish ranging from salmon roe, botan ebi, yellowtail, tuna, chutoro, salmon, fluke, and uni.

Although we had a good time, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back, and here&#39;s why. <br><br>Kakuni (Berkshire pork belly): this is a must. It was so perfect we ended up ordering another one at end of our meal (yes... as a dessert). <br><br>Karaage (fried chicken): unusual and tasty. Very tender. <br><br>Chawanmushi (savory egg custard with chicken and crab): a mistake. I was expect something completely different. Don&#39;t order this, as it&#39;s a waste our your stomach space (and money).<br><br>Yakitori (Japanese bbq): butakushi (pork belly), gyutan (beef tongue), kamouaki (duck breast): although not particularly memorable, they were quite good. If you don&#39;t like searing your own meat, don&#39;t order the duck. <br><br>Miso black cod: very delicate and quite tasty. <br><br>Rice with sea eel: not your usual eel over rice. The eel is braised to the point that it shrunk to barely anything, and tastes overcooked; the rice looked amazing, but didn&#39;t have much taste.<br><br>We skipped dessert, mostly because 1) the list was uninspiring, and 2) my wife couldn&#39;t order the only interesting option - their $20 green tea tiramisu - because she&#39;s temporarily on a non-dairy diet. <br><br>Their seats are creative, with a clean space for your belongings (probably to hide them from the smell of the kitchen... yeah, your clothes will be smelling like food for days), but the design is cheap, because you&#39;re sharing a 2-inch back pad with the person behind you, which can be quite annoying when you get an idiot who can&#39;t stop pushing toward you (like I did... a woman who pushed me several times and then went ballistic when I finally pushed her back...once). <br><br>Overall, although the food was 4-stars worth, we felt that the service was rushed. Our waitress - initially helpful and polite - kept pushing us to order more items together, which is not what you want to do knowing that they would all come at the same time (and get cold).

Their food is very good to excellent and the service was great! The ambience is calm and demurred (we were the loudest ones there). <br><br>K and I were here for a friend&#39;s birthday. The six of us sat at the largest table in the back (table for 8). We ordered the following.<br><br>Nigori sake (unfiltered sake) 12 oz- this was great because it was smooth, had a silky-milk mouth feel and packed a punch without tasting like a higher alcohol content. <br><br>Otoro- the fatty tuna slices were satisfying and rich. It was delicious and pretty. The chef topped each slice with gold flakes, making this dish even more decadent. <br><br>Smoked duck- this was perfectly tender, had a fatty duck skin layer and delicate smoked flavor. <br><br>Yudoufu (Hot homemade tofu cooked with negi and shiitake in a wooden box)- I loved the presentation and taste of this dish! The tofu was placed in a wooden box with a fire in the lower compartment. The view of the tofu, Japanese leek, and broth was not beautiful but the combination had such a depth of umami flavors. Everything was perfectly cooked: the silky housemade tofu, the crisp sweet leeks and the savory broth. It was one of my favorite dishes. <br><br>Gyu-Tataki (Lightly roasted Washu beef with ponzu dressing)- this was like tender beef sashimi. The beef was seared ever-so-lightly so you could barely see the cooked outer ring. The ponzu sauce was a citrusy slightly sour soy sauce.<br><br>Oden Mori of 5 items- Egg, daikon, bean curd, mushroom and taro cake simmered in dashi broth. This was excellent. It looked ugly but <br>I loved the soul warming rich flavors from the dashi. Everything was perfectly cooked. My favorite was the daikon and gelatinous taro jelly cake.<br><br>Karaage (Japanese fried chicken for $12)- this was such high quality fried chicken. It was so light, perfectly seasoned and the chicken was very juicy. It was a thousand times better than the karaage I had at a restaurant in St Mark&#39;s (and costs $3 more).<br><br>Hotate Butter (scallops cooked in butter)- the scallops were fresh, briny and buttery. One piece was little overcooked but the flavors were just right.<br><br>Butakushi (Kurobuta fatty pork belly roasted)- fatty roasted pork belly. This was so good that we reordered it.<br><br>Gindara (Black Miso Cod)- this was seared so it had a crunch and was so tender. The miso added so much delicate rich flavors. I wished I had one to myself. <br><br>Kakuni (Berkshire pork belly simmered in sweet dashi broth)- This was ok. The flavors were great but some pieces were tough. The best pieces were the ones with a chunk of fat. <br><br>Kurobuta Tamago Toji (Kurobuta pork belly simmered in dashi broth with soft scrambled egg)- this was delicious steamed egg with ground pork belly with a dashi broth. It was savory, slightly fatty and very tasty. <br><br>Jidori Liver (roasted chicken livers)- flavorful and tender. Good if you like liver.<br><br>Gyutan (thick-cut Washu beef tongue prepared in Sendai style)- This was cooked medium rare. I liked the tender beefy crunchy beef tongue but some cuts were tough. I also like beef tongue well done. The medium rare beef after taste was not so good. <br><br>Inaniwa Udon- udon in chilled savory sauce topped with tiny tofu and shiitake. This was savory and delicious. The tofu was silky, the udon was perfectly cooked. The udon also helped round out the meal so we all left full.<br><br>Sanma Shioyaki (grilled mackerel)- this was flavorful and perfectly grilled.<br><br>Onigiri \u00a0(Crunchy grilled rice cake) topped with soy sauce - this was rice seared so it forms a delicious crunchy layer. <br><br>Onigiri \u00a0(Crunchy grilled rice cake) topped with roe- this was the better of the two onigiris. The salmon roe offered a tiny vesicular crunch compared to the crunchiness and stickiness of eating a seared layer of rice. <br><br>It was a delicious fun meal! You could taste the high quality ingredients and the care the cooks took to make each dish. I would order the onigiri with salmon roe, the tofu, beef tongue, oden, and pork belly yakitori again. <br><br><a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fsnackchatnyc&amp;s=56428c5b64e7b8a8e4db84064c2699532ec754fbd1334b6503e08a9ec1accd1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/snackchatn\u2026</a>", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 27, "reviewCount": 7, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "3/30/2022", "comment": {"text": "This place is super cool and authentic.

The mayo one was very disappointing as the texture just felt like eating a spoonful of mayo. On the other hand, the seared salmon had no sauce and was too dry. I felt like they should&#39;ve combined both flavors because one was too wet and the other one was too dry. On top of that, you can&#39;t taste anything from the salmon because there is no sauce and it didn&#39;t seem marinated, and it was torched too much.

We also added on the lettuce saam set, soybean stew, potato noodles, and cold noodles. <br><br>I really have to commend Yoon on their beef, which was incredible and cooked to a perfect medium rare. 2 meats were definitely enough for the both of us, &amp; it ended up being a lot of food! The wagyu short ribs were soft &amp; tender, &amp; I enjoyed these with the sauces that came with the lettuce set. While it&#39;s a bit mind boggling to pay $7 for a lettuce saam set, it was really necessary to get the full experience of making wraps and having the additional sauces - Yoon only provides a dipping salt and sesame oil. To be fair, the set was generous and comes with lettuce, perilla leaves, endive, carrots, garlic, &amp; jalapenos. My favorite cut by far though, was the marinated short ribs. Each piece was flavorful &amp; tender, &amp; worked well with or without the sauces. <br><br>A few notes about the other items we ordered - the cold noodle broth was different from other places I&#39;ve been to, but still made for a good accompaniment to the BBQ experience. In comparison, the soybean paste stew was initially good, but ended up being a little too thick and beef stew-y - not really what I had in mind when wanting a stew!

However, one sip of the broth and I knew this was going to be a long meal. The broth tasted like salt thrown in some water with a little bit of some kind of protein. It was honestly one of, if not, the worst ramen broth I have ever had.

Place is a little hard to locate, upstairs from another Japanese spot. Setting is quiet, relatively intimate, suitable for conversation and a leisurely meal. Service was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. From a fairly limited menu we ordered beef tongue, kobe beef, assorted ribs, beef tendon curry rice, and sides of radish/cucumber sticks, roasted assorted vegetables, and salted cabbage. <br><br>The meats: beef tongue was a surprise hit. Thinly sliced, savory, and quick to crisp, we enjoyed both the flavor and texture. Kobe beef was lean as expected, but very tender when cooked to medium (comes in cubes). From the assorted ribs, there is a center portion of chuck short rib that was absolutely delicious. Not fatty, and yet extremely tender, juicy, and flavorful. We ordered a separate order of just this chuck rib, it was just that good. The other portions included a portion of short rib and short plate, between which I think the short rib was a little better. Meats come with no sides and two dips - a soy-based and a mungbean based (I think). Both are excellent; the soy-based one seems to complement the meats a little better. The curry rice was not that memorable, but the tendon was tender. Among the veggies, the corn and onion were surprise hits. We ended up grilling the salted cabbage for a little extra flavor. Radish/cucumber sticks had very little flavor in themselves, but was a nice palate-cleanse. <br><br>All in all, I would highly recommend this place if you want to enjoy the natural flavors of good, grilled meat in sensible portions.

It kind of pissed us off because they are very incompetent when it comes to managing the outdoor situation.

Then after we went over the menu and was ready to order, the said male waitstaff came over to us and we later learned that his name was &#34;john&#34; trying to help us but his English is not the best but that&#39;s okay, nothing wrong with that except the fact that he remains muted and never answer our question about the food and just nodded every time we asked question is really infuriating. \u00a0Why hired someone who clearly can&#39;t communicate well enough to be in the front of the house.

This is the one I promise you won&#39;t regret it. <br>Recs:<br>Food wise I recommend getting a bunch of plates and sharing so you can try multiple things. I love the fried platano relleno and the arepa churrasco. The guac app is really solid and well portioned and I love that it comes with pico as well (and plantain chips which imo are far superior to regular tortilla). I&#39;ve had the empanadas and really liked them too. Honestly everything here that i&#39;ve tried has been delicious. <br>Drink wise I usually have their virgin mango mojitos (I don&#39;t drink) and could literally CHUG it by the gallons it&#39;s so good. I&#39;ve eyed the frozen margs tho and they look amazing. <br>And my biggest MUST HAVE: THE TRES LECHES!!!

I&#39;ve had my fair share of unseasoned raw beef tongue, and there should be a subtle beefy flavor and slight chew, neither of which this had. The rest of the meat itself was also really mediocre. I never order my meat marinated at JBBQ or KBBQ, and praise for the natural juices of the meat itself, but the meat here had absolutely no flavor or texture. <br><br>The worse was our grill did not get hot enough and it took almost 5 mins just to cook the piece of cabbage till it wilted (it usually takes seconds on a normal grill).

The sausage was smoky, salty, and just perfect. The chicken was marinated in a sweet, spicy glaze and grilled up so well. My beef-eating friends enjoyed their ribeye and tenderloin cuts. <br><br>We also tried various other items on the menu:<br>-I had the Late Blossom cocktail (sake, lime, lychee, jasmine, Angostura). It was good: fruity, slightly floral, and sweet, but not saccharine.<br>-To kick off our meal, we did a little shrimp cheers with the Shrimp, Quail Egg, and Shiso appetizer (served together on a skewer). It was delicious and had a soft sweetness to it, almost like honey walnut shrimp. <br>-The truffle fries were a satisfying appetizer and not too heavy on the truffle oil. No notes. <br>-You&#39;ll definitely want to get a rice or noodle to pair with your grilled items, and the hot stone garlic rice is a great choice. You can let it crisp up by allowing it to sit for a while the bowl it is served in. <br>-The vegetables (asparagus, mushroom, onion) were a good accompaniment, although I didn&#39;t think the mushrooms - which I typically love - were very exciting when grillled. They, along with the rest of the dishes, benefited from the complimentary sauces. <br>-The cauliflower is a rare dish here that came out pre-cooked, as it was prepared tempura-style.

After thorough research, I stumbled upon Yakiniku Futago. What initially drew my eye was their prefix, so I decided to try it out for lunch. Upon walking in, I did like the darker, yet alluring interior; however, I was a bit surprised by the minimal attendees despite it being a Saturday (I think I found out why).<br><br>After being seated, I was ready for the $125 prefix, but to my disappointment, they do not serve the prefix despite it being on the menu. They also have a lunch menu on their website which they did not provide (for the record, both menus are glitchy on their website). For me, that was a point off in my head because of the high price tag, I somewhat expect attention to detail. Instead, they highly encouraged their treasure box, but I wasn&#39;t ready to pull the trigger because it didn&#39;t offer anything else besides the wagyu for $200. As a result, my partner and I decided for A La Carte and ended up getting a lot than I first expected. <br><br>Unfortunately I didn&#39;t take pictures but here are my thoughts:<br><br>Lightly seared Wagyu, Zuni &amp; Shiso: (5/5) and excellent and delicate bite. The wagyu was cooked perfectly and the uni was absolutely delicious. I will note, their uni is probably one of the freshest I&#39;ve had. Not gassy or fishy, very creamy and a little sweet. I was impressed. <br><br>Thick cut tenderloin steak: (4/5) pretty standard tenderloin, a little on the chewy side, but I expected that. <br><br>Assorted Namul: standard prepared namul, nothing special to note.<br><br>Grilled Oysters and Mushrooms, soy butter: (4.5/5) very well seasoned and aromatic. <br><br>Wagyu Sushi Assortment: (5/5) I was caught by surprise. The wagyu they chose was pretty high quality and they didn&#39;t &#34;cook&#34; it like you normally would. It was a beautiful texture and it was delicious.<br><br>Bone Marrow Spicy Soup: (5/5) this was excellent. Very flavorful from the bone marrow and also very balanced. The heat or the savory flavors were not over powering. I would say this serves 3-4 small bowls.<br><br>Hot Stone Garlic Rice: (4/5) I was wondering how garlic rice could cost $18, so I had to try. Honestly, it was good, but not $18 good. The server cooked the rice pretty good. Crispy on the bottom and cooked thoroughly. Definitely complements the meat so I would encourage you get it with the prefix. Crispy garlic rice, can&#39;t go wrong.<br><br>Japanese Cold Noodles: (3.5/5) a pretty small portion, but a decent way to end the meal. <br><br>One last thing, service was excellent. I forgot our Japanese server&#39;s name, but he was very attentive, confident in his cooking, was very calm especially with both eyes on him cooking wagyu, pretty knowledgeable around the menu, and very polite. 10/10 I praise the our service.<br><br>Overall, Yakiniku Futago has pretty good quality wagyu, but it is on the pricier side. I got more meat for maybe 2/3 of the price at Toraji. Maybe it would have been worth it if we got the prefix (Lesson learned, don&#39;t go for lunch unless your goal is the Treasure box). I believe my bill for 2 people came out to $325 before tax and tip. If you&#39;re thinking about this place for a special occasion, I would suggest only the prefix because that&#39;s a full meal, the treasure box is only the slab of wagyu for $200.

The salmon was at an awkward temperature, which made the inari itself taste a little off but either way the inari was still delicious. <br>+ Salmon (4/5): The freshness of the salmon didn&#39;t quite shine through, but like the torched it was a little dry so I&#39;d suggest the spicy mayo version! <br><br>Overall, it&#39;s perfect for a light snack if you&#39;re out shopping in the Soho area!

They should feel sorry for their meat, selling such nice meat with such bad service is sad. <br><br>Got here without a reservation since Opentable have all the time slot available and making reservation need to put down the c.c information and I was feeling lazy for that. So I wasn&#39;t expecting the restaurant would be crazy busy which is true, they open at 5PM, for here at 645PM with 5 tables inside, restaurant itself isn&#39;t big so 5 tables is almost half of the restaurant. First, there a hostess station in the front but no one is there nor any notice regarding anything. So we stood in the front for a bit hoping someone will come, but some server were standing in the dinning room looking confused even they saw us waiting in the front but I guess there only one server do the sitting job since he was the only person doing so the whole night. <br><br>We finally seat down, while we still taking our jacket off, someone came and ask for our drink order, my jacket was literally half off and I haven&#39;t even scan the menu yet, like chill. Would be nice if they can give us some water, we got NO WATER during the whole meal. Is funny when you pay for such pricy meat, you will think, I could at least get some water right? Nahhhhh not here. <br><br>We order one beer and one coke, and the coke came in a small glass bottle(233ml), but other than coke, I see all the other soft drink come in a can(355ml), all customers \u00a0paid the same price but got different quantity of beverage. Why? That shows how unorganized this place is, the lack of caring and management really get to me. <br><br>I ordered garlic scallions soup which it suppose to come with beef and daikon. However, when the soup came, it was FULL OF EGGS inside which it was mention on the menu and then I realized it was the wrong soup later on when I double check the menu, which is fine since I was planning on taking it home since I was getting full and the soup itself was huge. But that&#39;s the worst part of the night. After we paid, we asked for a to go container to pack the soup to go, the server brought us a container that can&#39;t close, top and bottom are different set which I don&#39;t know how that happened. From there, we literally asked 3 different servers and one just completely ignored us, he literally knew there no lib for the bottom that they gave us or something, he said &#34;ok&#34; to us and never come back, another one brought us the wrong lid and tried to close it for us on the table.....and said she will look for a lib and never return. What is sad is that they seat us at the bar, so we saw everything and how everyone react including the manager, maybe two of us didn&#39;t order the whole kobe beef so they don&#39;t care about us, after 15 mins, we need to ask another server and he asked the manager and seems like she knew there no lid for the bottom since the last server also asked her. Is fine to let us know they are out of to go boxes so we can just leave but what is funny is that, at the end, the server brought us a smaller container and asked us to put it there.....at this point, dose it really matter. What is even funnier is that the manager at end come to the door asked what happened, we literally watch her the whole time tell the server to look for the lid and none of them found it and she said &#34;I was busy&#34; so why are you here now trying to asked what happened? <br><br>They open at 5 PM, they have so much time to teach the staff and restock the restaurant before opening.

We saw plenty of tables with used napkins and plates sitting around for ages without being cleaned. No one ever smiled or looked glad to be alive. The servers all looked like zombies.<br><br>Cleanliness: Our booth table&#39;s seats were ripped; the menus were sticky with what felt like years of sweat and soda stains; tables were not clean. Worst of all, we saw old rice stuck to our grill because it hadn&#39;t been cleaned properly.<br><br>Food: Who combines multiple side dishes onto a single plate? They were clearly not freshly made (days old) and definitely all store bought. All the juices combined together and you couldn&#39;t taste one thing from another. The meat wasn&#39;t fresh, the cuts weren&#39;t good, and no one ever explained what ANY of the meats or dishes were. We ordered a meat combo, and the meat arrived on a big plate, but the cuts were indistinguishable. It&#39;s hard to mess up stone pot bibimbap, but theirs was one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>STAY FAR AWAY--this place is posing as a restaurant.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 3, "reviewCount": 3, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "2/26/2023", "comment": {"text": "Went there for Valentine&#39;s Day.

I use Yelp sometimes when I happen to be someplace I do not know, and I have no regular spot. Reliability is a significant criteria for restaurants, and this satisfies the standard. But sometimes you need to try new venues. To experiment with food makes you better as a person, in my book, and I confess I may be less enthusiastic about making friends with those who are unwilling to try new cuisines. So I found this place here on Yelp. I often am in mid town for business, then headed back home to Queens. This is en route.
