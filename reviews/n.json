The fried chicken was about on par with church luncheon fare where chicken was fried the night before, refrigerated, reheated, and then kept warm in serving trays for a few hours.

I do think some of the items on the menu are better than the others, but that feels pretty typical for tapas. <br><br>Side note: I wish we had known about the tasting menu beforehand or that when the restaurant had mentioned this option when they called me to confirm the reservation of our large party. Had we known, we probably would have opted for this but did not know until it was too late. (They need 24 hr notice for the tasting menus.) So, we ended up &#34;making our own&#34; tasting menu. <br><br>I will list below what we ordered and coordinating thoughts:<br><br>Gambas: (shrimp dish) This was a dish we all really enjoyed. It has shrimp swimming in oil and garlic and was just the right amount of seasoning. We ended up ordering 2 of these. <br><br>Zanahoria: (carrot dish) I was hoping for more flavor from this dish, this was one that had caught my initial attention but I didn&#39;t think it was anything sensational. I don&#39;t think I would order it again. <br><br>Carpaccio: ( mushroom/truffle dish) This was my personal favorite bite of the night. The mushrooms are flattened and are topped with the perfect amount of oil, cheese and nuts. This really blew me away and may be one of those &#34;dream bites&#34; for me. <br><br>Bravas: (fried potatoes) Normally I love potatoes bravas and I was sad that I found these to be just ok. We had ordered two of these, but probably only needed one. I&#39;ve had better potatoes bravas at other Spanish tapas spots. <br><br>Colifor: (caulifower) My friend was super excited to try this but this was my least favorite bite of the night. It has a very earthy (grassy?) flavor. If that is a flavor profile you enjoy, you may like this dish. <br><br>Churrasco: (steak) This was pretty good. I won&#39;t dream about it, but it was yummy. <br><br>Croqueta: This was my second favorite bite. I thought these were some of the best croquetes I&#39;ve had in the city. They were perfectly creamy on the outside and had a beautiful crunch on the outside. <br><br>I don&#39;t see the dessert menu online but we did opt in for two different dishes. <br><br>Goat cheese cheesecake: This was surprisingly delicious. It was an interesting mix of both sweet/savory and had a lovely jam/marmalade on top which added alot of flavor. <br><br>Chocolate mouse: We also had a chocolate mouse swimming in some orange emulsion. This was delicious and rich, we loved it!<br><br>We also opted to get the sangria as we heard how good it was. This rounded out for a lovely dinner and recommend getting a pitcher for the table. <br><br>The service here was great, we kept ordering additional dishes and the server was super attentive and helpful with suggestions. <br><br>The interior was minimal but aesthetically pleasing, I won&#39;t elaborate too much because it looks like they may be relocating. <br><br>All in all, I&#39;d give Nai a solid 4/5. Most of the dishes were good, a few were standouts and some I&#39;d skip.

I also ordered the yuzu shiso mocktail which was tasty.<br><br>I really loved the food here, the fishes are super fresh and you can taste the natural sweetness in the fish. There&#39;s not a lot of seasoning on the fish, instead of pre-seasoning the fish, the chef brushes a stroke of sauce on top of the fish, which helps preserve the original flavor of the fish. The entire meal is on the less salty side, at first I thought that the courses are a bit under seasoned, but eventually I came to really appreciate the lightness in flavor because I can enjoy the original flavor of the fish more and I didn&#39;t have to drink a ton of water like I usually did at other sushi restaurants. The amount of rice of each course is also slightly less than elsewhere which i also liked, so that I wouldn&#39;t get too stuffed after the whole meal.

While Chef Nakajima tries to be playful throughout the evening, there are moments where you wish he would be a bit more serious. Instead, I felt like I was at the circus the entire time, and especially with the weird shenanigans the crowd was pulling off, it was just a very weird experience (more on that later).<br><br>So for the starters, it was probably the most mid set of appetizers I&#39;ve ever had. The clam soup was strong flavored, and not very savory or soothing. It was just clumpy and didn&#39;t have much flavor. The Uni seaweed salad felt like a waste of uni. It was an assortment of very water vegetables, which watered down the uni, and was way too cold for my liking. The bonito sashimi was just ok, and had way too many onions on them. The fish tasted like raw meat more than fish, and I felt that more prep could have improved the texture and flavor. The squid tasted like something I&#39;d get at a mall, especially the sauce which was strikingly sweet and very crude. The grilled fish was way overcooked, and the only interesting part of the dish was the exotic red fruit. But the fish itself was flavorless and overcooked.<br><br>Ok so the apps sucked. The omakase must be good, right? Yes it was good. Was it mind blowing? I would say no. The quantity is not very much either, i think you get around 8 pieces, but ok, the cuts are pretty thick, and the flavor is strong -- which btw I think is a pretty salient characteristic of all the food here. It&#39;s ok to have strong flavors, but up until now, I felt that the flavors were all very strange and nothing really tasted that good. The nigiri procession was all good, but just not enough. Wish there was more focus on this part rather than the very underwhelming set of appetizers.<br><br>Finally the closing grilled fish was ok, and the Tamago was good. The mochi dessert was also very good and apparently a recipe from Chef Nakajima&#39;s grandma.<br><br>As promised, the shenanigans. So the crowd I was in, included &#34;regulars&#34; who got Chef to write them a poem and draw a picture at the beginning of dinner (delaying dinner by around 20 min), people constantly buying him champagne (and these are heavy pours), someone gifting him expensive liquors, and people who ended up buying a whole tray of tamago. It&#39;s ok to do these things, but it just felt so obtrusive to the whole experience. It just felt like a weird flex competition, and I didn&#39;t want to be any part of it. I also know it&#39;s fine for the chef to drink some alcohol during service, and I do offer sometimes as well, but I disliked how much Chef (probably felt pressured) to drink so much, and it seemed like enough to the point where it would impact his cooking.<br><br>Nakaji is a different sushi establishment, but it is not well-polished, still under experiment, and varies highly on your crowd you dine with.

Pricier side for an omakase. Good for a special occasion. No truffle on your nigiri here, just a progression of edomae sushi. Probably not your style if you&#39;re looking for shaved bottarga and foie gras medallions on top of A5 wagyu beef.<br><br>This was one of the last meals we had before the shut down. Tucked away in the tunnel running between Elizabeth Street and Bowery, lies Nakaji. If you used to hang out in Chinatown, they&#39;re in the space that Yummy Noodle used to be in. Behind the wooden door, you&#39;ll feel like you were transported somewhere else.<br><br>We had the late reservation so we stopped by the cocktail bar. I felt like I was whisked away to Tokyo. The minimalist design, the soft piano jazz, it was undeniably a Japanese bar. It appears you can also order a la carte here as well if you&#39;re not in the mood for a full tasting. I ordered the Bowery Smoke, they use this device to basically place a bubble of smoke in the drink - cool to watch. She ordered the Marimo which I remember being pretty tasty.<br><br>Finally we were seated. I can&#39;t express how much I love the design here, it&#39;s so clean and simple. We wanted to get one of each omakase because she usually gets full but they requested that we order the same menu. Slightly inconvenient but nevertheless we followed their request.<br><br>Chef first began with some small appetizers. Abalone which looked like it was simmered in some sort of braising liquid. Wonderfully chewy, simple, that luxurious texture you get from abalone. Next came firefly squid with this miso sauce topped with sesame seeds. March is the season for this squid so, yeah that was pretty awesome. Sashimi arrived with some type of amberjack fish (I forgot which) topped with perilla flowers, thinly sliced onions and freshly grated wasabi on the side. The last appetizer was this lightly battered fried fish. Holy shiznit, this might have been one of the best pieces of fried fish I&#39;ve ever had. It was encased in this delicate batter and as your teeth cracked into it, hot moist fish would just flake apart. Nothing more than a touch of salt you could taste, because nothing more was needed. It was enjoyable as the corner of a mac &amp; cheese pan or the crispy skin on a good roast chicken. Just give me more of that, now.<br><br>I really like the way chef slices the ginger pieces into thick rounds. I&#39;m not a fan of the crumbled thin-slices personally. It just gets tangled up when you want a piece. The sushi began. Shamefully, I do not remember what the first few pieces were. I think the first was a striped jack, the second I believe was fluke, the third was horse mackerel. All were excellent. Next was a piece of fresh mackerel and to be honest, neither one of us is really a fan of mackerel. Chef insisted that we try and if we didn&#39;t like it he would comp us another piece. It was phenomenal, what he explained was that the aggressively fishy taste you usually find is when the mackerel is not fresh enough. This tasted way different than what I&#39;m accustomed to. Next, squid which he artfully scored in a hash pattern so that the chef&#39;s soy sauce would be tucked away in every space to deliver a fantastic bite. Just enough chew to it with plenty of flavor as you smiled while eating it. Sweet succulent snow crab was next. The next two white fishes were great. Goldeneye snapper was next, I&#39;ve become a fan of it being slightly seared but it&#39;s just as enjoyable without that. You really get to taste the flavors of the fish because seared fish tends to take on a pretty similar flavor across the spectrum. That being said, seared fish is so friggin&#39; delicious. Japanese uni was next, just creamy, nutty, lushness. \u00a0There was not much tuna served in this meal but the one piece we got was a fabulous slice of medium fatty tuna. Marbled, tender and a proper final piece right before the eel. Of course, as tradition has it - the sea eel was the last piece. A drizzle of sauce, the taste of sake as you chew through it.. so good.<br><br>Dessert was simple, A piece of mochi dusted in green tea, a couple slices of imported strawberries (so sweet that it tastes like juice) on a plate. Our time was the last seating for the evening so we even got some extra slices of chef. A few swigs of wine and sake probably helped too.<br><br>Excluding the beverages, the omakase at that time was $195 pp. I believe it is now $225 pp. So if you&#39;re going for the larger omakase, with tax and a 20% tip on subtotal; you&#39;re looking at $580 for two people without alcohol. So, this is not a cheap restaurant. If you&#39;re a fan of purist sushi, looking to celebrate a special occasion, Nakaji is a good choice. Unless you just got it like that, ball out. I personally usually like to be within the $200 pp (all in) range but I do love trying all the omakase I can.<br>Bottom line, Nakaji can stand on it&#39;s own against all the edomae sushi bars in the city.

Yes, the skewers are pricey BUT they come with the full mezze spread a/k/a salatim. Those sides are also refillable as well. Once each member of your party has ordered at least one skewer, all subsequent skewers are 50% off. Top 3 skewers I&#39;d rank are 1) Branzino, 2) Octopus Shishlik, 3) Juicy Lamb Kebab. Don&#39;t sleep on the Tatami for dessert.<br><br>I struggled for awhile as to whether or not I should dine here. At first glance, the restaurant is usually empty and the price of the skewers is not cheap. Most skewers are between $30 and $40. After doing some research though, I came to realize that you get the mezze spread complimentary and those sides can also be refilled. That makes the price way more reasonable.<br><br>As far as the sides go, the potato dishes are insane. The potato salads and the potato with scallions are incredibly delicious. The potato salad is chunky, it&#39;s got just the right amount of tang and its wonderfully refreshing to eat. The baked potato with the scallions are what you wish you could make your baked potato every time. Here&#39;s a pro tip: use the sour cream with spicy peppers to mix in with it. Thank me later.<br><br>The skewers here are tasty, they do use good protein but the real magic is in the seasoning and the way they&#39;re cooked. The generously season with flaky salt and coarse black pepper. This makes all the difference with each bite having this crunchy coating with a moist/juicy protein underneath.<br><br>The branzino is definitely my favorite. It comes crispy, butterflied and each bit of the meat is perfectly flaky. The octopus is succulent with this bouncy texture but fork tender in the middle. The lamb kebab is like a long burger with good seasoning and yes - it is juicy. I&#39;ve had most of the skewers, the beef ones are fine but I would recommend the ones I referenced above.<br><br>When you factor in all the mezze plates and the proteins - you&#39;re probably looking at around $100 to $120 for two. Which is not all that different from what you&#39;d drop at a steak house or a decent KBBQ meal.<br><br>If you have room, I&#39;d recommend you try the tatami. It&#39;s their take on a tiramisu and.. that thing is damn delicious.<br><br>Why the 4/5? Despite this being the proper restaurant from Miznon group - the service has been lackluster to awful at times. That being said, the food is good enough that I&#39;ve come back multiple times.

We were planning to dine at Jose Andres&#39;s Little Spain marketplace downstairs because we had a nice meal at La Barra the last time we visited (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3QUs31y&amp;s=24f4464718aa72134af39c591c587a80ef95dd9d9ac346047dfca9f94835e6d8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3QUs31y</a>). Unfortunately, they were an hour away from opening the restaurant, and we needed to be at the theater for a matinee by 1PM (tapping my watch). Wow, I sounded like a housewife from Tenafly, didn&#39;t I? Presuming ignorantly that it was Italian for all the fresh tomatoes lined up everywhere, I knew nothing about the restaurant and the more casual looking place next door (Miznon), but I figured out later they were two variations on the same operation serving fresh Israeli food.<br><br>Their primary menu items were skewers, about two feet long each and about a dozen different types ranging in price from $28 for vegetables only to $47 for foie gras steak. I took notice of them in a display case as we entered the restaurant. However, the true emphasis is on the mezze plates that arrived before our skewers. In something of a stunt move, the server came with a huge tray filled with sixteen different plates which he breathlessly described in quick succession. It was difficult to keep track, but they included matbucha, eggplant, roasted bell peppers, tomato foam with schug, octopus, lavan, freekeh, and a variety of tahini, creamy hummus, and babaganoush (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3AC3gdm&amp;s=dc0398e3c9c0bc3dd2a05a98c274b662455d8e69ce4f2db2c2bb021d2c79240b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3AC3gdm</a>).<br><br>Of course, there was housemade pita as well, very fluffy and addictive, and while we were stuffing ourselves silly, our skewer orders arrived, one $39 Duck Breast and one $28 Only Vegetables (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3cbpqK4&amp;s=2886a82564a69c5f64efa277200a39221ad517f1523486dc51daf65c9ca29528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3cbpqK4</a>). They were fine, but honestly, we were mainly gorging on the mezze plates which were replenishable free of charge. We were stuffed, and we still had that walk to the theater to consider. Oy, we didn&#39;t want to make digestive noises during Sondheim as that would be blasphemy. However, we were under control and already thinking we want to come back and try those mezzes again.

The service is always friendly and fast. \u00a0I will say the Vietnamese coffee was a bit of a let down as it was served in a paper cup, rather than an actually cup with the extra hot water on the side in a small thermos. Even then, I still think they deserve 5 stars as the food is very good and the service is great.

Sure it&#39;s a couple extra bucks but it&#39;ll save you the hassle. <br><br>The host/server was super friendly and nice. Since we were the only group there I can&#39;t say how the service would be when the place is busy. At the end he asked us if it&#39;s our first time there (which it was) because he said he&#39;s never seen our faces before.

What we ordered: <br>Lunch special (chicken), shrimp yangoon, palak paneer, garlic naan and samosa chaat. <br><br>Samosa chaat ($7) was great.

Since parking sucks, my husband dropped me off and I went in first. I was seated right away but wasn&#39;t offered any water right away. I looked around the restaurant and they were busy for a small place on a Saturday night. My husband finally showed up about 5 minutes later (still no water) and we looked through the menu and decided what we wanted. <br><br>Eventually someone finally came to take our order and we were left to wait. During wait, I noticed people coming in after me who were getting \u00a0fresh starter bread. Believe me, it was better that we didn&#39;t get any bread, but being seated, literally, in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by people who came in after me, I started wondering why we weren&#39;t provided any starter bread. I thought maybe they were still making some fresh, but in the end we never got any. <br><br>Regardless I was hoping their service would pick up and the food would make up for their lack of attendance to our table. We ordered the samosas for an appetizer, which I have to say , was highly disappointing. It tasted like it was preheated with an overly hard shell and dried out potatoes on the inside. I definitely don&#39;t recommend ordering the samosas. My husband also ordered this lemon ginger tea, which took so long to get to us, that we had forgotten we even ordered it until the waitress came up to us and told us SHE forgot to bring it to us. She said she had made it and forgot about it. She did apologize for it and she was really nice so we couldn&#39;t feel some type of way...but it&#39;s really not great as first time patrons....<br><br>Anyways, we ordered two types of curry: churpi subzee (vegetarian curry) and chicken Makhani (non-vegetarian curry). We got a side of rice and an order of garlic nann. The curry and the nann was definitely amazing. \u00a0I&#39;m not sure why but I expected the curry to be spicy, but it was not what I expected. After our main dish I ordered a dessert named paan which is basically made out of leaves. For those who are used to normal ice cream flavors, I don&#39;t recommend this to anyone. It&#39;s definitely an acquired taste and it cleanses the palette, but truthfully, my first thought after the first taste was that it tasted like an air freshener. I was skeptical at first but remembering the wise words of Andrew Zimmern, always try food twice to really judge it!

I was worried about it being cold but it said there would be heat lamps. \u00a0Weather was nice so it was just fine. We got in right at the time of our reservation, then waited outside for about 5 minutes to be seated. <br><br>There are instructions on the table on how to eat the temaki. There&#39;s a plastic layer separating the seaweed and rice to keep the seaweed crisp. Instructions are on how to remove the plastic while keeping the temaki in tact. If you&#39;ve ever had convenience store fist rice (this is a direct translation from korean), it&#39;s essentially that method. <br><br>5/5 shishito peppers - the peppers werent too spicy, just a small little kick so you know they are peppers. They were a little salty and sour on their own, delicious in a light way. The sauce (smoked honey miso) was a star on its own. I would recommend this just for the sauce if you&#39;re not a huge fan of spicy things. For fun you might try dipping the temaki in this sauce too. <br><br>5/5 signature set - they are known for their temaki so i had to get the signature:<br><br>tuna poke, crispy shallots - delicious! The shallots were great texture contrasting the tuna.<br><br>x.o. scallop, tobiko, lemon - my favorite. I only like raw scallop and this was amazing. Soft, big piece of scallop melting in your mouth. <br><br>kanpachi pineapple, chipotle, onion, koji - i like when fruit is in a savory meal. Its always interesting and adds a refreshing touch so i was really excited about this one. It delivered on that and was a bright addition to the set. <br><br>coconut shrimp, green curry, lime, cilantro - coconut shrimp was crispy. Interesting flavors together. I enjoyed this one, only wish the coconut shrimp was a little less crispy.<br><br>cucumber black sesame, shiso, plum - this looks really interesting with the black sesame sauce on top of a piece of cucumber but I found it be the least interesting to eat. There&#39;s really just one main texture: the cucumber. Love the creativity of black sesame, shiso and plum but the execution lacked a bit for me. Would be better with one more texture. <br><br>All the seafood melts in your mouth-exquisite!You will likely need to finish each in a few bites so it does get a little messy as you hold it together between each bite. I liked the variety in here, different protein in the three that had meat, then a fruit, and a vegetable. Each delivered a different flavor profile and texture. <br><br>Amazing experience.

I walked into the restaurant with my niece and sister at \u00a0the same time a couple did. Both of our parties were seated outdoors in the little sidewalk dining boxes, literally right next to each other. The couple was smart enough to take two menus from inside the restaurant when we were being walked to the outside tables. We didn&#39;t. We sat there for 15 minutes before deciding to look at the menu on our phones. The waitress came and took the couples order next to us, didn&#39;t look at us yet once. Time stamp for all this taking place now has been us being seated at 1:00, (I know bc I sent a text the same time), couple placing their order and and now getting it by 1:30, us still not even seeing the waitress. She pops in around 1:45 when I was opening the sliding door to go inside the restaurant and asks us if we got any menus yet...it&#39;s 1:45. We said no worries with the menus we looked on our phone. She apologized and said they&#39;re short staffed which is understandable. We&#39;re giving her our order to take but she can&#39;t bc the electronic handheld ordering machine she has isn&#39;t working so she said she had to go get it fixed inside. Another 15 minutes go by. We see her taking other tables orders so at this point we&#39;re now \u00a0getting up to leave but lo and behold, she is coming back to us at this same time, 2pm we put in our order. This food has to be amazing. I mean, the yelp reviews say this food is amazing....for the amount of time we&#39;ve been here pleeeeease be amazing. The couple next to us has gone by now bc duh, they ordered, received and ate their food all before we even got to place ours. Two tables across from us that were seated well after us have already gotten their food, 2 tables with parties of 4ppl each!!<br><br>We get our food at 2:30, then the utensils bc up to this point we&#39;re sitting their with a table of three glasses of water which I guess is fine considering we had no food.....reminder, we got to the restaurant at 1pm and have at this point seen tables come and go before even getting our food. <br><br>Let&#39;s talk food; my sister and I got the bulgogi burgers, my niece got the teriyaki chicken bowl, we ordered a scallion vegetable pancake, beef dumplings, and sweet corn. ...The beef dumplings were good. My sister didn&#39;t even eat her bulgogi burger, she tasted a piece of bulgogi and instantly decided she couldn&#39;t eat it. I was starving, I ate my food. It was 2:30 and I hadn&#39;t eaten from the day before, so whatever was in front of me was getting in my stomach. <br><br>Guys....you&#39;re in for a treat if you like food that tasted like it had seasoning then was washed off through a mesh strainer. Honest to god, the blandest Korean food I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t know how the reviews are so high. Maybe the actual bbq with it being done at the table is what got this restaurant rated so high but it most definitely wasn&#39;t off of the bulgogi burgers or the teriyaki chicken. If you have a sensitive stomach and can&#39;t tolerate spice or too much seasoning, or any seasoning, then yes, this place will be good for you. If you can wait over an hour to get your food, then yes, this place will be good for you. <br><br>I&#39;ve never been to a restaurant in the city that didn&#39;t have good food, this is it.

We stressed the point that she is allergic to shrimp and shellfish and can not have any products within our meal. We received the pancake, and began eating. Each of us had started eating, with several bites in. Our waitress then came back to the table with a new pancake, to inform us that we had received a seafood pancake instead of vegetable. When I explained that my friend is DEATHLY allergic to shellfish, she told me that it was only squid. She apologized and was clearly removed as our waitress. When our new waitress came to cook our food, she stated that she wasn&#39;t sure what the seafood in the pancake entailed and that it &#34;could possibly have shrimp&#34;. At this point, we called over the manager to explain the situation as my friend is now panicking and readying her epi pen. The manager proceeds to tell us that the pancake includes crab, squid and shrimp but &#34;they are small pieces.&#34; If you have a severe allergy, you know it is not the size of the food that causes a reaction, but just the simple presence of being touched or contaminating your food. When we stressed the severity of this and that our friends life has been negligently put at risk, he let us know that they &#34;have insurance for that. &#34; No apology, no attempt to rectify the situation, or attempt to admit fault.

Fine dining can sometimes get labeled as &#34;pretentious&#34;, and in some cases, that is true, even if it is short-sighted. For me, fine dining is about experience and adventure. Trying new cuisines and exciting takes on traditional courses that come from a place of love for food, culture, and the customer. That love was felt at Naro.<br><br>From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff who were extremely attentive. We were promptly and quickly introduced to the team of folks who would be taking care of us. The ambiance inside was sublime; not too noisy and intimate without being too isolated. My wife and I opted for the tasting menu and enjoyed a few of the signature cocktails while we dined.<br><br>What became apparent with the first couple of dishes arrived was the commitment to experience as we were instructed to eat the first two dishes with our hands. This tactile engagement with food is something that traditional fine dining scoffs at, despite the enjoyment it brings to the diner. Across all the courses we ate, all of which were outstanding, some of our favorites were the Striped Jack Mulhwe, the Potato Jeon, and Sea Bass Gui. The Mulhwe had a delightfully crisp and fresh taste that wasn&#39;t overbearing and reminded me of the time between winter and spring by the sea. The Potato Jeon is pure comfort food with class and was a perfectly savory delight nestled in the first third of the meal. Lastly, the Sea Bass Gui incorporated elements neither of us had tasted before including Aehobak and Sujebi which playfully complimented the sea bass in a light, but flavorful broth.<br><br>When it comes to the cocktails, both the Daehan Old Fashioned and Ibha Sour are not to be missed. Probably the smoothest old fashioned I&#39;ve ever had, and the Ibha sour was so good it was all my wife wanted to drink...that is, until the espresso martini. Most places have this drink, but none of them taste as velvety or as smooth as the one at Naro. Easily one of the best we&#39;ve ever had, and with a high recommendation for a great after-dinner drink. We shouldn&#39;t forget that the dessert was also innovative, fun, and delicious. The Chamoe Hwachae was a perfect palate cleanser before the Ganhan Pecan!<br><br>I could go on about how much we loved our time at Naro.

Well worth $95 per person. Overall would say 8/10 for food. <br><br>[Gim Bugak]: this complimentary snack was actually my favorite part of the meal. They serve about 3-4 pieces of fried seaweed laver (nostalgia anyone?) It is delicately seasoned with some green tea powder and brings just the right amount of crispiness and saltiness. <br><br>[course 1 | Octopus Naengchae]: I&#39;m not a huge fan of radish or octopus, but I did enjoy how light this dish is. The acidity definitely stimulated my salivary gland and appetite as I found myself excited and ready for the main courses.<br><br>[course 2 | Chicken Sanjeok]: it&#39;s a few pieces of chicken with squash skewered together. I really liked how they used chicken sausage instead of chicken breast/thigh which can get stringy and dry when skewered. This course is also surprisingly filling!<br><br>[course 3 | Wagyu or Halibut Sooljjim]: I had the Wagyu. Plating was beautiful, although the actual meat was a little too fatty for me, even with the fermented kimchi on the side. Perhaps should have gotten the halibut which my mom really enjoyed. The main courses come with mushroom rice with doenjang (soybean paste).

Great, fresh flavors that surprisingly resulted in a different aftertaste after each bite.<br>- Shrimp Jeon (Dogani, Bok Choy, Jalape\u00f1o Jangaji): Another favorite. It was like if someone had tasked the chefs at NARO with making the BEST seafood pancake they could. And they nailed it. <br>- Sea Bass Gui (Potato Sujebi, Perilla Seed, Aehobak): ANOTHER solid course! Fish was cooked perfectly and the skin was crisp and flavorful.<br>- Pennsylvania Golden Chicken (Ogok Bap, Woodear Mushroom, Daechu, Chrysanthemum): I&#39;m starting to sound like a broken record but this was also fantastic.

Can&#39;t wait to come back and try dinner!<br><br>Went with a friend for lunch on a Saturday. I was surprised that it was so easy to book, considering the reputation of the chefs. We got the Lunch tasting menu which comprised of one &#34;snack,&#34; three savory courses and a dessert. We were very intrigued by the NARO bap that we saw online so we added that as well. <br><br>Our meal started with the gim bugak which was essentially a fried piece of seaweed laver and they seasoned it with gochugaru and green tea powder. If you&#39;re not familiar with these, I think that these would impress you more. I&#39;d be lying if I said these made me excited for the meal, however, they were delicious. I loved every other aspect of our meal: the octopus dish with the donchimi granita and radish was clean, light, acidic and a great start to our meal. The chicken Sanjeok was very tender and flavorful. I was surprised by the texture because I thought we would be served a chicken thigh or breast but it was a sausage and I quite enjoyed it, more than I thought I would. The NARO bowl was wagyu, egg custard, roe, chives and crispy rice. I&#39;m such a fan of crispy rice and I found this to be extremely satisfying. If the price tag doesn&#39;t bother you, I suggest you add it. My friend and I shared both entrees of wagyu and halibut and I loved them both. The halibut was so tender and I really enjoyed the light, soju-based broth with the citrusy topping. The mushroom rice that was served with both dishes elevated the experience. The mushroom rice was one of our favorite parts of the entire meal. It had this doenjang emulsion that was great. The wagyu was served with kimchi juice which I found necessary to cut through the fattiness of wagyu. <br><br>Dessert was my favorite part of lunch. The tasting menu dessert was injeolmi ice cream, brown rice caramel, a crumble and a cocoa tuile. So delicious. We were craving an additional sweet, so the waiter suggested the Kkwabaegi which he said was his favorite. Honestly, I grew up in Koreatown on the west coast and this was super nostalgic of the Korean doughnuts I ate growing up, but it didn&#39;t feel $20 to me. I think I&#39;d go with one of the other dessert options in the future. <br><br>The service at NARO was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had recently. I remember accidentally ordering sparkling water for both me and my friend, but she wanted still. When they learned of this, one waiter picked up her glass of sparkling, another set down a clean glass, and a third filled the glass with still. This all happened in an extremely efficient motion. I was very impressed. My friend didn&#39;t even realize that they had switched out her water; it was that effortless. We had conversations with our waiters that made them feel very personable and fun. The interior is extremely sleek and modern with clean lines. I think its perfect for dates or special occasions. <br><br>I want to say that I was a little apprehensive before coming because I saw a couple other reviews on Yelp that thought that this place was mid. I think I can understand why someone may be a little unimpressed some aspects of the menu - the seaweed chips and doughnut dessert weren&#39;t the most exciting, especiallly for the price tag.

Usually the broth kind of informs the noodles, so if the broth has a good flavor, it&#39;ll seep into the noodles and just make everything taste better. But because the broth was not great, the noodles also didn&#39;t have the flavor I was looking for. They were a bit rubbery and unappetizing as a whole. The one saving grace of this bowl of soup was the chicken. Even though they were slightly soggy from the trip home, they tasted great. But after I finished all of the chicken, there was nothing left to make the soup/noodles taste good, so I ended up throwing out the rest. <br><br>The naruto ramen wasn&#39;t as flavorful as we were used to and the meat included was on the harder side. My mom ordered the veggie shoyu ramen and appreciated the spinach noodles but wanted more vegetables included inside. <br><br>Everything was just on the bland side; there&#39;s definitely better ramen in the city to try.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 2}, {"photoCount": 48, "reviewCount": 48, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "6/21/2023", "comment": {"text": "this is the first ramen bowl i&#39;ve ever had that wasn&#39;t too rich or too salty or too heavy. delicious! super fast too. stopped here on a whim and now I think this might be my new ramen spot", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 734, "reviewCount": 307, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "10/31/2021", "comment": {"text": "Service was great and the staff was wonderful.

The con was that there was a lot of broth compared to ingredients (which might be an issue of getting takeout). The broth was also really salty, so I wasn&#39;t able to slurp down all the broth.

They&#39;re open approximately from 5 or 6:00 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday but I&#39;m not positive and I would call them. They also are occasionally out of dishes such as kababs the night I went which was perfectly fine for me. Also added Persian to the listing (and I am pretty sure this is permanent and not a pop-up.)<br><br>As a very big fan of Persian food and having not really found any spots that serve good versions of traditional Persian grub (and specifically Fessenjan/Fesnjon,) I was very much looking forward to this place once it opened. The first time I went here, they weren&#39;t open yet and the second time they were quite crowded so as noted, I would probably recommend calling them as their hours don&#39;t exactly seem accurate yet. <br><br>The service was friendly though a bit overwhelmed with the waiter telling me to tell him when I wanted my main dish.

The upstairs dining space is elegant looking with there being a good amount of space between them and light music.<br><br>I started with the Kuku Sabzi ($9) as I wanted something lighter which is essentially an herb frittata. This dish consists of fresh cilantro, parsley, dell, garlic, eggs, zereshk (aka berberis/barberry a common sour berry tasting kind of like a red currant,) walnuts, and spices served with tomato, cucumber, pickles, and homemade bread. This was an alright version. I found it a bit more soft compared to some other spots with the spices being a bit lighter. It came with three reasonably sized chunks. The bread I believe was Barbari which is different from the usual sangak you find in other spots. I saved a bit at the end to sop up the next dish but one of the waiters took it away.<br><br>As my main dish I got the Koresh-E-Fesnjon more commonly spelled as Fesenj\u0101n/fesenjoon which was $28. Said dish consisted of crushed walnuts, saffron, pomegranate molasses, and ground meat served with basmati rice on the side. The waiter informed me that it was made with a chicken leg instead which I was fine with because I am definitely more used to that from other spots but I really wouldn&#39;t mind trying the ground meat version also. It came topped with more pomegranate seeds and the rice had a bit of saffron of course along with a small piece of Tahdig, also known as scorched rice which is a beloved food of the country. The stew was outstanding being the closest I&#39;ve had to some spots in Ridgewood (NJ not Queens) with a perfect mix of sweetness and savoriness. It was just nutty enough, just thick enough, and just sweet and sour enough (you can basically insert a Goldilocks quote here.) I informed the waiter after I finished and they said this was an old family recipe and it tasted as such. The chicken was fall of the bone tender as well. .I would likely try the Zereshk Polo Ba Morgh next time which looked outstanding on another table or the Ghormeh Sabzi. The tahdiq was a bit less crispy than other spots but still tasty.

Come mostly for the atmosphere, but the dogs and fries are good too. <br><br>Vibe: 4/5. We visited the original Nathan&#39;s famous location on 4th of July for the annual hot dog eating contest, so naturally the place was beyond packed. The behemoth of a hot dog stand has several walk up counters where you can order. Be advised, during our visit the registers were organized where you had half of them taking orders for hotdogs and the other half for the rest of the menu due to the popularity (unsure if this is how they normally operate). To the immediate right of the restaurant there are a handful of umbrellaed picnic tables that you can use to dine. During the 4th, the street directly in front and intersecting the stand is partitioned off, so navigation around the blockades was cumbersome. <br><br>Service: 4/5. Even with the crowds of 4th of July, service was as quick and punctual as you would expect from a fast casual restaurant. All registers were manned at all times, making the large order lines move relatively quickly. Most of the delays occurred at order pickup, but this is to be expected from the influx of business during the hot dog eating contest. Nathan&#39;s typically offers mobile ordering as an option, but during the 4th they had opted not to offer it which was a bummer. <br><br>Food: 4/5. Decent dog and exceptional fries.

I&#39;m a huge fan of the cuisines of that region (Malaysian and Indonesian -- try out Kopitiam and Awang Kitchen if you&#39;re interested in further exploration of those countries!), and there&#39;s something really magical about how Singapore&#39;s cultures are reflected in their delicious food. The Night Market was such a great first venue, because it approximated the experience of hopping between stalls in a Singaporean hawker center. <br><br>You&#39;ve GOT to try the chili crab buns ($8), and order the extra buns because the dip portion is generous. omg, what a delicious combo -- I&#39;m not normally a bun/dumpling person, but these golden-crisp, pillowy mantou are perfect. I like to split the buns in half and pour some dip over, then fold the bun back together so that it makes a teensy, sloppy slider. This is a classic dish and the chili crab is super umami and delicious.<br><br>The shrimp fritters ($7.50 for 5) are whole shrimp coated in a golden, airy batter and fried to perfection; while they are a big unwieldy to dip in the sweet chili sauce, I ended up just pouring some sauce over the length of the shrimp and found that a much easier way to eat them.

The Singapore noodles had a pretty solid seasoning blend and the signature turmeric-yellow color (though I feel like I remember my favorite restaurant&#39;s rendition being a little spicier??), and went well with a shrimp addition. The Satay Peanut noodles were also well-sauced, and had excellent textural contrast with sliced cucumber, a soft-boiled egg with a perfect jammy center, and crispy fried shallots. Both of these can be had vegetarian, though I think it&#39;d be hard for vegans to find a complete meal here since a lot of the noodles are egg noodles and most dishes contain eggs or meat.<br><br>When I come back, I definitely want to get some of their kaya (coconut jam), which is, to me, one of the best sweet condiments!

For how much food I ate, I would have paid closer to $25. This was a complete rip-off and I would not advise anyone to choose their large-party menu.

We were on our way to the Museum of Sex, and we were hungry. It&#39;s not that our meal was awful... in fact, my fiance and I have had worse. As far as diners go, in Manhattan at least, you just never know. You might stumble upon the best food ever, you might find something truly mediocore- but you know what they say, bad diner food is like bad sex. Even when it&#39;s bad.... ok never mind. <br><br>For starters, the waitress was a space case. I mean, we got our Diet Cokes alright. Then we ordered spinach dip. The menu told us we had a choice between pita or tortilla chips. Pita please. She said they didn&#39;t have pita. Okay, chips. The dip was more like a bowl of oil with some spinach and melted cheese. (Not her fault.) Again, it wasn&#39;t awful. But I&#39;ve had better spinach dip at Applebees. And that&#39;s not saying much. My fiance tried to order some melted cheese over his sandwich. The kind of cheese he wanted was listed as being melted over a different kind of sandwich. The waitress replied that they couldn&#39;t melt THAT kind of cheese over his sandwich because it was shredded. What? We tried, to no avail, to explain that you could, in fact, just melt the shredded cheese over the sandwich he wanted just the same. Eventually it was easier just to move on because she was not getting it. The look on her face indicated that though she was physically present, her mind had taken a trip to Mars. <br><br>But moving on... his sandwich came, with a different kind of melted cheese. My veggie burger came. Guess what it came on? A pita! As in, that which we wanted for our dip but were told they had none. And oh, it was BLAND! If I&#39;d wanted a pita with some ketchup, mustard, tomato, and lettuce I could&#39;ve just ordered that. Minus the flavorless patty in the middle, it would have tasted the same. The french fries were equally devoid of flavor. My fiance compared the whole thing to cardboard, actually. He was correct in his judgement. <br><br>After all that, we weren&#39;t going to push it with dessert. Our bill came to $27, including 3 sodas and 2 lunches. So, reasonable. But not worth going back unless we&#39;re desperate. <br><br>Sidenote: The decor is simple, but nicely done. Muted colors, interesting table tops, art on the walls. But avoid the bathrooms.

Naughty Crab popped up on my Instagram, I went to yelp to check out the reviews and they seemed pretty decent, so I knew this one was worth trying. <br><br>First things first, this is an Asian owned establishment, so a lot of the flavor profiles will resemble that of an Asian culture rather than your typical old bay and butter. <br><br>I arrived at 6:30 and on weekdays HH is until 7. Through HH I had a $6 cocktail and $1 per piece of oyster or wing. They also had $5 appetizer options and $1 per piece of their lollipop corn. For drinks, they have a list of cocktails, beer and wine. Mind you, the cocktails are present as virgin so the descriptions only show the juice &amp; flavors, no liquor. Upon inquiry, the only liquor they have is a Korean vodka that can be added to any of the cocktails to make them alcoholic. So there&#39;s no whiskey, tequila, rum etc option. I ordered the passion fruit mojito and it was quite tasty. No buzz or anything so the drinks weren&#39;t too strong but it definitely tasted good. The grilled oysters were amazingggg, super fresh and a nice texture with the toasted breadcrumbs, garlic and lemon. I do recommend. For the wings I tried their Cajun and black pepper. Both were good, the Cajun is dry and the black pepper is more wet (to my surprise, I assumed black pepper would be a dry rub but it&#39;s more like a black pepper sauce) but both were good.<br><br>For the boil I had a pound of snow crab legs with corn in their naughty sauce. Their naughty sauce is a compilation of lemon butter, garlic, black pepper sauce, essentially their signature sauce. It could&#39;ve been a bit more potent, or like BAM with the flavors but it was still good, just not as in your face as I would&#39;ve liked. The garlic noodles were the best things hands down. 10/10 recommend.<br><br>All in all, this spot is decent.

The restaurant seems to be perched on top of a very tall hill and seemed very popular. <br><br>We were seated at the very end of their outdoor seating area. It felt a bit precarious like we could roll down the hill at any moment. Unfortunately our experience very much did. <br><br>My girlfriend got a mojito and I unfortunately, had to drive. In hindsight, I probably could have gotten away with one drink since my girlfriend&#39;s mojito seemed to have a nonexistent amount of alcohol in it. For appetizers we started with some grilled oysters. For me some of the breadcrumbs seemed burnt on but otherwise it was decent. For our main, we decided to share a boil bag. We got half mussels and half crawfish and added some sausage in for good measure. Unfortunately it took them closer to an hour to give us our food. We hungrily watched, as people who got seated before us, got their appetizers, multiple drinks and entrees before we were even checked on. After a certain point, we got fed up and asked about our food. Our waitress told us it would only be another five minutes. After that our server seemed to disappear for a while. The manager ended up having to bring our food out out saying that he was sorry for the delay and added some extra corn and potatoes (which kind of shows that they forgot our order). The crawfish and mussels were mediocre at best. We had about 7 dead mussels that didn&#39;t open their shell. The extra sausage for 5$ turned out to be small slices of half a sausage. Needless to say the main was a huge disappointment. <br><br>When it came time to pay, I noticed that they tacked on an automatic 18% gratuity. While I&#39;m all for tipping well and helping servers, I think that they should definitely allow for customers to decide what to give. Automatically tacking on tip for a party of two seems cheap. The funny part is that when you pay with card, they leave a blank line for EXTRA TIP! So make sure to read your receipt. <br><br>I had a horrible time at Naughty Crab.

The waiter was nice and friendly <br><br>What I didn&#39;t like:<br><br>1. The drinks were $12, which I&#39;m not mad at. What I&#39;m mad about is that the drinks were so watered down that they tasted more like juice. If you&#39;re going to charge top dollar for a drink, at least put some liquor in it. <br><br>2. There&#39;s an automatic 18% gratuity added to parties of<br>(2) or more. Yes, that wasn&#39;t a typo. 18% gratuity for<br>(2) people. Now listen, I&#39;m a tipper. I think it&#39;s so &#34;le rachet&#34; to not leave a tip. However, there should&#39;ve been signage saying that there&#39;s a gratuity added or<br>The waiter should&#39;ve stated that before we ordered.<br>Tip should be an addition based off of the quality of service. Not an automatic addition to the bill. <br><br>P.S.

As with most assembly-line restaurants, you first have to pick your base, then you choose your protein and you finish it off with your toppings. Viola. That&#39;s it.<br><br>Of course, the ingredients will be comprised of Middle Eastern ingredients and they are all DELICIOUS. Personally, I always love getting the bowl and it is ridiculously filling. For the bowl, first, you have to choose between Vermicelli Rice or Freekah (if you don&#39;t know what Freekah is definitely google it.) Next, you have a number of proteins to choose from. You cannot go wrong with the Chicken Shawarma or Falafel here. Lastly, you choose your toppings, and there are PLENTY to choose from. If you&#39;re not sure which one to choose - well, you can choose them all at no additional cost! That is all there is to it. Also, don&#39;t forget to ask for your free pita too.<br><br>As for this location, the employees have always been friendly and I&#39;ve never had a complaint or seen a reason to complain.

Apart from the efficiency, service was just ok. Our server would treat us friendly at one moment then cold the other. <br><br>As for the food, we ordered the:<br><br>-BABA GHANNOUJ: Yummy dip that came with some warm bread. The flavor was great, it really highlighted the eggplant taste and texture and was just a great way to start off our meal. We did not finish the whole dish and our server was kind enjoy to package the dish for us with some fresh, warm pita. <br><br>-BEMIEH BEL LAHME: This was a daily special for the day so we just wanted to try it out since it was slightly chilly that night so made for a good stew-eating day. The flavor was very bold and delicious. The tomatoes really complimented the okras well; however, I would only recommend this dish for people who actually like the taste of okra because it was a very prominent note and would not be enjoyed if you do not like the taste and the texture of the veggie. <br><br>All in all, definitely one of my more enjoyed restaurants in the city and I am always excited when I get to go try it out!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 3766, "reviewCount": 841, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "4/27/2018", "comment": {"text": "The Quick: Such A gem for lunch!

We had changed our reservation to be a little later because I thought I would be late, but actually arrived there sooner than was expected. The hostess said she could not accommodate seating us before the time of our new reservation time. She was polite but firm about it so I appreciated that. She let us know when our table was ready and it wasn&#39;t a minute before the reservation time. <br><br>The decor of the restaurant was okay. It was sleek and modern, with white walls and lighting and railway style seating. We were seated a little bit towards the back which I think was better because we had more room. <br><br>We ordered several appetizers: Fattoush, Hommus Lahme and Rekakat Bi Sujuk. First we were given a complimentary snack trio of crispy pita chips, olives and some sort of sauce with sesame seeds for the chips. The chips were bland and the sauce was not really to my liking. <br><br>The Fattoush was a salad that consisted of mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, radish, green pepper, onion, toasted pita and vinaigrette. It was light and the vegetables were fresh, but I wasn&#39;t that impressed. It was healthy but not all that flavorful. <br><br>I liked the Hommos Lahme better, which was hummus with minced sirloin beef and pine nuts. This came with a ton of pita bread. I enjoyed the hummus mixed with the beef, but the pita was kind of blah. <br><br>My favorite appetizer was definitely the Rekakat Bi Sujuk, which looked like adorable little spring rolls. It was phyllo dough filled with Mediterranean cheeses and spicy beef, though the meat wasn&#39;t spicy at all. The ingredients came together really beautifully here and it was nicely seasoned and very tasty. I definitely thought 4 pieces were not enough! <br><br>For the main course, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Roll and it came with 2 sides. This was strips of marinated chicken with lettuce and pickles/garlic in a pita. The chicken itself was great with delightful flavor but I really did not like the addition of pickles with it. That actually kind of ruined the dish for me and I wasn&#39;t able to taste the garlic at all. For the sides, I selected grilled vegetables and french fries. The sides were wonderful! They were pretty generous with them. The vegetables (red peppers, zucchini, eggplant, onion) were grilled to perfection and the fries were crispy and fluffy.<br><br>The service was all right.
