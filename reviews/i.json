Over the past year, I ate at Sushi Zo twice at the recommendation of my colleagues. While I feel like Sushi Zo is slightly overpriced at $250, the style speaks to me. It&#39;s simple and delicious. But my boss kept saying how much better the restaurant was when Chef Masa was there. So I just assumed that Ito would be a better version of Zo. Ito is very different.<br><br>Dinner was 18 courses for $275. When I first saw the price, I was relieved that it wasn&#39;t $400. But I have mixed feelings about this price too - it&#39;s no bargain.<br><br>My favorite items from the night were their signature dish (uni and ikura atop sushi rice), chutoro from Japan, bafun uni sushi from Hokkaido, nodoguro, and the Yamazaki A5 wagyu sushi.<br><br>If you notice which my favorites were, they are pieces that you would expect to be good. It is also likely that these premium ingredients are what increases the cost of the menu. Though if you removed them, the restaurant would have little to fall back on.<br><br>Ito reminded me of Shuko - it felt like a new, updated version. But I struggle to see why someone should spend $275 to go to Ito when they could eat at Shuko, Ishikawa, or Kissaki instead. And I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend those over Sushi Ikumi, Sushi Noz (Ash Room), or Sushi Ginza Onodera (lunch) either. $275 is a lot of money and as the price of the omakase increases, the bar is set much higher. I think Ito will struggle to find and retain their target clientele in the long run given what they offer relative to the competition in the NYC market. <br><br>To be fair, it seems that the main issues that I have with the restaurant are that the style doesn&#39;t fit my preferences and price. I understand that there are customers who are seeking luxe shops that serve wagyu, caviar, uni, and toro.

In my opinion, yes and no. First, the good. The menu at this cart is huge and in all of my years of eating from food carts, I don&#39;t recall ever seeing a menu with so many items listed. They have multiple sections to their menu falling into either Veggie Halal, for the non-meat eaters, or Special Indian, which is for the carnivores.

All of the right ingredients were in this biryani dish, including the half tea egg. However, what disappointed me was the rice. The rice was dry and over-cooked. It surprised me that something so simple could be overlooked, but the dryness of the rice really took away from the rest of the dish since there was so much rice. The rice is really the cornerstone of chicken and rice or biryani and when the rice is not where it needs to be, it&#39;s obvious. In addition, the chicken was in very large chunks and not cut up into smaller pieces. I typically prefer smaller pieces of protein because with larger pieces I tend to eat it within a bite so there tends to be less protein as I get closer and closer to finishing.<br><br>I won&#39;t fully judge the cart just on 1 dish, but not fully coming through on one of their signature and more popular dishes is a bad start.

It was founded by executive chef Eric Lind. Over the course of his career, Lind had the pleasure of working under the mentorship of many talented chefs and restaurateurs in New York City, New Orleans and Italy. Eventually he wanted to open a restaurant of his own and found a location in Battery Park City. Lind named his restaurant &#34;Inatteso&#34; (meaning &#34;unexpected&#34; in Italian) because he liked the idea of having a pizzeria that would offer customers more than what they normally expect. In addition to their Neapolitan-style and Sicilian-style pizzas, Inatteso also offers house-made pasta dishes and modern interpretations of classic Italian entrees. Lind also opened a sister business, Inatteso Cafe, right down the block in 2008 as well. <br><br>My son and I recently had lunch at Inatteso while we were cycling along the Hudson River Greenway. By the time we made it to the Battery Park City area, we were starting to get pretty hungry. The pizzeria is conveniently located right alongside the popular trail. We walked in right after they opened for the day. I really liked the interior design and the staff were friendly and helpful. My son and I munched on some delicious freshly baked complimentary bread as we looked over the menu. After looking over the cocktail selection, I decided to order a &#34;Lemon Spritz&#34; (gin, Italicus, lemon, soda splash). I think lemon-inspired cocktails are so refreshing during the summer months, and this one was no different. After looking over the pizza menu, my son and I decided to go classic and order a &#34;Margherita&#34; (mozzarella, basil, olive oil). The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside yet a little chewy on the inside; like toasted Italian bread. The sauce was very flavorful, the mozzarella melted in my mouth, and the basil tasted like it was just picked from the garden. This was very good pizza. I can tell that my son really enjoyed it because he barely said a word the entire meal. We both really enjoyed our lunch at Inatteso and we&#39;re happy that we discovered it.

This place caught my eye (and nearby Sauce &amp; Barrel, which I really liked during my first and only time there, closed earlier this summer), so my chum and I wandered over yesterday. <br><br>I&#39;ve walked by this place a handful of times; it&#39;s a very gentrified area and for me, a lot of the buildings/businesses kind of blend together - it&#39;s basically the NYC equivalent of Newport right across the river. That&#39;s not a ding on Inatteso, but I think a lot of the establishments in this neighborhood by definition have difficulty standing apart because of it. Your mileage may vary. That said, this is a very pleasant location in many respects.

It came fairly quickly - one of the great selling points of traditional Neapolitan pies - but personal palate-wise, I&#39;m not crazy about big chunks in my tomato sauce. \u00a0There were a few noticeable pockets of oil still lingering on the top of the pie, and the dough was more chewy than airy for me. The cheese was fine, but fairly indistinguishable. I still had four slices, but I left the remaining half of the pie in the work fridge for the public to consume. I also had a Paloma ($16); also fine, but I think I&#39;m officially over that cocktail - it&#39;s refreshing on a day like this, but for me it just seems bland and a little too tart. That&#39;s also not something I think is necessarily an issue with Inatteso specifically, but their cocktail menu isn&#39;t lengthy (and half of it is negronis) so in the future I&#39;d stick with a glass of wine; THAT part of the menu is pretty extensive.<br><br>The service was fine, and the price point here is pretty competitive for the area; underscoring that fact was that the clientele was a solid mixture of nearby residents and tourists passing through.

I have had hundreds of omakase meals at this point and my experience here was one of the very best. <br><br>Icca is a sushi temple with almost an entirely wood interior with sweepingly high ceilings. I liked this as this was a departure from many sushi establishments where the ceilings are lower and provide a lesser sense of awe for guests.<br><br>I would describe Chef Kazu in three words: craftsmanship, mastery, and showmanship. The atmosphere is lightened from his lively interaction and his ability to communicate with his guests. I always engage all sushi chefs at the counter as I feel it is a vital part of the experience and to add to my limited knowledge of sushi. His willingness to answer my questions without hesitation was a highlight for me, personally.<br><br>Our menu included the following: chilled zucchini egg custard, tairagai sashimi, kawahagi with liver sauce, steamed Japanese awabi, awabi liver sauce nigiri, capellini pasta with Hokkaido kegani and uni, Hokkaido wagyu (N34), baby ayu, managatsuo, kinmedai, hon maguro, squid ink sharisotto, iwashi, grilled hotate, madai, botan ebi, nodoguro temaki, otoro, kohada, ishigakigai, Hokkaido uni, unagi, tamago, amadai soup, and corn cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e as the dessert.<br><br>Every course that was presented to us held their own and were of the highest quality. That is the key to a strong omakase, where no courses are weak and presented in their most optimal way to showcase both the flavor and texture of each item.<br><br>For me personally, the awabi liver sauce nigiri was one of the best bites of food I have ever had. This is not an exaggeration or an outlandish statement from my perspective. The rich, decadent, and umami saturated liver sauce coated each individual grain of rice with a velvety, viscous consistency. This was harmoniously paired with the optimally warm temperature of the rice; which provided an absolutely orgasmic level of ecstasy for the taste buds. For my next visit to Icca, I will specifically request additional pieces of this unbelievable nigiri if possible. Unfortunately, Chef Kazu could not accommodate my request for additional awabi liver sauce nigiri that night as there was a very limited quantity of it.<br><br>The other standout dishes included the kawahagi with liver sauce, capellini pasta with Hokkaido kegani and uni, squid ink sharisotto, iwashi nigiri, ishigakigai nigiri, and surprisingly, the corn cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Kawahagi, also known as thread-sail filefish, is an exceptionally rare fish with a chewy texture and consistency. The rich liver is extracted and used as a sauce for the thin strips of kawahagi for a somewhat noodle-like experience. The chilled capellini pasta featured luxurious Hokkaido kegani and uni; the combination of all these ingredients was absolutely sublime and a clearly unique item that I&#39;ve never seen on any other omakase menu. The Italian flair of the menu was continued with the squid ink sharisotto, with the pronounced earthy flavor of the squid ink coating every grain of rice; it paired nicely with the briny, sweet, and creamy components of the Hokkaido uni adorned on top.<br><br>For the conventional Japanese items, the two items that I favored the most were the iwashi (sardine) and the ishigakigai. As the hikarimono class is my favorite type of neta, this was definitely a highlight for me. The iwashi was quite large and had the clean oceanic taste and slightly oily consistency from the tender flesh. This was definitely of the highest quality, quality that I have similarly seen from Yoshino and Noz 17. The ishigakigai (Bering Sea cockle) was particularly bouncy but tender at the same time; it was an interesting texture as normally clams can be overly rubbery if not particularly dispatched at the counter or stored properly.<br><br>Chef Kazu understands the temperature of the shari is important, and I observed him switching and changing the rice for every two pieces of nigiri. This involves more work, but this is what I have noticed all the very best sushi chefs do. He uses a blend of two types of Hokkaido rice, not of the koshihikari variety from what I was able to understand. The individuality of the rice grains, the acidic sweetness from the Yokoi akazu, the disbursement of the rice grains on the tongue as the nigiri is pressed up against the roof of the mouth, the formation and volume of the shari, and the aforementioned temperature of the shari were all exactly as they should be in classic edomae nigiri.<br><br>I would like to say that the &#34;holy trinity&#34; of New York City omakase is represented by Icca, Sushi Noz, and Yoshino. Granted, I haven&#39;t been able to try every high-end omakase in the city, but I can confidently say that these three establishments should be on the top of any sushi connoisseur&#39;s list.

Sushi Ginza has a well-priced lunch course but the dinner menu always looked too expensive for the offering. Icca is a way better restaurant. At the recommendation of two trusted friends who spoke very highly of Icca, I decided to make a reservation.<br><br>Icca&#39;s counter is headed by Master Chef Kazushige Suzuki, an incredibly kind, engaging, and welcoming sushi chef. I was lucky to be seated directly in front of him and we chatted about Japan, restaurants, his work, and sushi throughout the evening. Chef Kazu&#39;s personality, combined with the beautifully constructed room and counter, created a calm and relaxing environment that added to my enjoyment of the meal.<br><br>Icca is built on three culinary pillars: Edomae sushi, Japanese beef, and Italian cuisine. \u00a0While I could have done without the beef and Italian food, they did not distract too much from the main event. I believe that the Japanese otsumami, nigiri, and related items were much stronger than the auxiliary elements even though dishes like capellini pasta with hairy crab and uni still showcase Chef Kazu&#39;s skill and creativity.<br><br>Throughout the evening, I noticed a number of things that set Icca apart from the other top-tier sushi restaurants in NYC. Chef Kazu used a number of sauces apart from the traditional shoyu and nikiri such as a sake dipping sauce for the sashimi and white shoyu on one of the nigiri. The seared bonito featured the tiniest dot of garlic chives/ramps that enhanced the flavor of the dish. His Ankimo was topped with pickle and a small dollop of Japanese mustard that added a great contrast of texture and flavor. And he featured seafood that I hadn&#39;t seen before such as hon ara for sashimi, umeiro (a seasonal snapper) nigiri, and ensui (salt-water packed) murasaki uni from Hokkaido that he served with a pinch of salt instead of soy sauce. If you watch Chef Kazu&#39;s Eater &#39;Omakase&#39; profile video on Youtube you will understand what separates him and his approach from other chefs.<br><br>I would be remiss if I did not mention the two outstanding abalone courses that featured the flesh and liver of the mollusk. The steamed abalone in kombu sauce gifts guests with the quintessential chew of the abalone (the gift that keeps on giving) and Chef Kazu&#39;s signature abalone liver nigiri is warm, rich, and coats the tongue in umami and delicacy.<br><br>Shion specializes in technical excellence and Amakusa seafood, Yoshino specializes in tuna, and Nakaji in uni.

Solid dish<br>- Trout tartare: this dish was unfortunately salty for me. Otherwise, the flavor was good.<br>- Seared tokachi herb beef: I heard this was the beef raised in their own farm in Japan. The beef was not too fatty, not too lean, and so tender. The pickles were surprisingly fresh and flavorful. The dish had different sauces, all of which went well with the beef and pickles. Another of my fav. <br>- Sauteed scallop: the cauliflower risotto was so so good! The scallop was tasty but unfortunately also a bit too salty for me.<br>- Penne bolognese: this was nice, but not memorable for me<br>- Icca soup: served in a stone cup, and very tasty<br>- Braised Beef: the beef was very tender and the sauce was nice<br>- Sweet Potato creme brulee: I loved this dessert so much. It was creamy and delicious, and had enough sweetness but not too much. This was served with the roasted green tea.<br><br>The place was quiet and peaceful. The service was attentive, even though there was a point, between the seared beef and the sauteed scallop courses, where I had to wait for almost half an hour for the next course. I&#39;m not sure why, but the pace afterwards was back to normal again. <br><br>Overall, I liked the food, some more than the other and none of them were bad.

Honestly, I thought it was a fantastic idea to open an Indian restaurant in the building, mainly to cater to the large population of Indian employees that work here. I would assume that Inday would have a steady stream of business, however it&#39;s definitely hard to predict because Inday is a fast food Indian chain after all and I don&#39;t know if many people would question it&#39;s authenticity.<br><br>Anyhow, with the above said, I decided to give Inday a try on the 1st day I saw it. Of course it didn&#39;t hurt that if I downloaded their app, I would be able to apply a $7 promo code + $7 app signup credit, so I did like that! The menu, albeit a bit small, consisted of some Indian favorites like Chicken Tikka Masala, Coconut Chickpea Curry, Saag Paneer, just to name a few. In addition, there are small sides like Roasted Brussel Sprouts or Coconut Chickpeas. These are just a few of the things you can order, but there aren&#39;t a whole lot more either. However, if you do those few small things correct, it&#39;s all that matters, right?<br><br>Since I had $14 in discounts, I just went all out and ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, a side of Coconut Chickpeas and a Mango Lassi beverage. In total, it came out to $22, quite the hefty lunch bill, but with my $14 in discounts, it was very manageable. However, without the discounts, chances were I would have kept my bill a bit lower.<br><br>So, how was the food then? It was all.....just OK. The Chicken Tikka Masala was decent, but the rice could have been better cooked as it didn&#39;t seem fully ready. Flavors were average for the masala. There was definitely flavor, but I&#39;ve had way better. In addition, the portion was a huge disappointment as the bowl was only half full. For $12.50, I would expect more, especially when other restaurants nearby (Naya Express, Chipotle) are packing their bowls to the brim. I did like the Coconut Chickpea Curry though. It was tasty and, most importantly, there were plenty of chickpeas inside. <br><br>Unfortunately, I never had a chance to try the Mango Lassi as they didn&#39;t have it. This was an even bigger disappointment than the portion of the Chicken Tikka Masala. I was stuck with drinking their &#34;Lemonaid&#34;, which was basically lemonade, with a small kick, in a bottle. Oh, and the Lemonaid was $3 less than the Mango Lassi to boot, so I felt a bit ripped off.<br><br>Inday definitely has potential, but I can see why there wasn&#39;t a lot of foot traffic here. Most of the attention was still paid to Naya Express and Chipotle. Although Inday&#39;s food isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s pricey for the small portion and I think most folks question the authenticity of the flavor because it&#39;s a chain.

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by 2 employees on the 1st floor before you can even access the other floors. The employees are very welcoming &amp; everyone was wearing masks. It&#39;s always best to book your tickets way in advance since it&#39;s not 200 seats like some other theaters. The second floor is where all of the theaters are but we&#39;ll get to that. What you need to be concerned with is the 3rd floor which is their restaurant (The Tuck Room) so you can get a little tipsy while waiting for your theater to open. Try to arrive 1-2 hours early to enjoy their happy hour &amp; drinks. IPIC has a full bar &amp; the bartenders absolutely know what they are doing. Every cocktail was perfect. You can always tell how good a bartender is by how their old fashioned tastes, it was delicious.<br><br>After I had a few drinks I headed to the theater. All seats are reserved so make sure you pick a good spot. The thing that sets IPIC apart from other theaters is the pod seating. It&#39;s not like an ACTUAL pod, more like what the seats look like in 1st class. The seats recline, you get a blanket, &amp; it&#39;s a button that you press whenever you need your server. Best thing to do is order your food during the previews so your food arrives at the beginning of the movie. If I could only recommend 1 thing I would say get the Meatza pizza, it was sooooo good. The buffalo chicken spring rolls, biscuits, &amp; truffle fries were also very good while the calamari was not so skip that. <br><br>The servers are nice enough to let you know when it&#39;s last call. I think they do last call when it&#39;s 45 minutes till the movie ends. I ordered 2 drinks for last call and enjoyed the rest of Black Widow. This dine-in experience was like no other.

I ordered the Ahi Tuna Nachos because I wasn&#39;t too hungry and just needed something with flavors to snack on. This dish surprised in so many good ways.

I enjoyed this dish so much that it was all me who munched on it. Also ordered the blueberry fros\u00e9 but was not a fan of it, just stick to the strawberry flavor.

They overdid the sour in the hot toddy and the bitters in the old fashioned. We shared the special salad which was Boston lettuce with chickpeas, quinoa, avocado, feta, and cherry tomatoes. The salad was really flavorful and the feta provided a nice balance of saltiness. I got the ahi tuna which came with snow peas, pickled ginger, and bean sprouts.

For instance, you can find some delicious crispy calamari, a tasty lobster quesadilla, Maryland crab cake sliders and a moist and lightly crusted yellowfin tuna burger if you are so inclined. We did and relished all but the crab cakes, which weren&#39;t bad at all but lacked the bursting crab meat flavor we&#39;ve found at a few other restaurants (looking at you Guppy&#39;s in Florida). We also, however, tried the Kobe beef hot dog, an item we have never seen anywhere before this.

We sat down, ordered two glasses of wine and a soft drink, and in about twenty minutes, the occupants of the shed table left. We started to move to that table but were asked to wait until it was cleared and reset. We were then startled to see other people sitting down at that table. When told that we could not have the table we had been waiting for we objected and said we would leave and dine elsewhere. As we were leaving a waiter told us that we would not have to pay for the three drinks we consumed. We got up and walked down Madison Avenue towards another restaurant across the street when we were accosted by the Island manager who demanded that we pay for the drinks. We said that the waiter had said that we did not have to pay for them in view of the failure of the restaurant to give us the table we had waited for. We went to the restaurant across the street, had an excellent dinner and were preparing to leave about an hour later when the Island manager and two NYC policemen appeared and threatened to arrest us if we did not pay $42 for the drinks.

After all, Japanese takeout isn&#39;t known for having generous portions. Maybe I&#39;m just too used to seeing sushi laid out on a plate as opposed to crammed inside a takeout box but I could have sworn all my other sushi excursions have involved, well, much bigger portions. <br><br>I just don&#39;t think the minute portions and the so-so quality of the fish justified the high prices. In total, one chirashi bowl, one naruto roll (without rice), and one tofu appetizer cost $45. $45!! I could have made an obscenely extravagant meal with $45. Look, I don&#39;t mind spending more on high quality food, even if that food requires me to eat a second meal. But what I don&#39;t like is getting mushy fish, taking gingery bites of said fish, and waiting in trepidation for my stomach to explode hours later. <br><br>Also, the tofu appetizer was absolutely laughable. They forgot to pack in a little thimble of seasoning and bonito flakes so when I unpacked the bag, I pulled out a small container of tofu blocks ... on a bed of ice chips. Yes.

Went for my father in laws birthday with my family and initially started out okay. A small thing was the waiter seriously tried to up-sell us multiple times, for example by only offering sparkling water to start, and pushing us 3 times to order drinks before everyone even arrived, which both we rufesed. The real issue started when my fourteen year old niece asked if her uncle (the birthday man) could get dessert on the house &#39;secretly&#39;, which they agreed to bring something out. I was actually surprised they did but was willing to pay for ONE dessert with a candle or something if she had been mistaken so I was not worried. They brought out a beautiful plate of desserts which we all thought was really nice of them, until we received the check with a charge of four desserts for over $60 alone. When I asked about it they said that my neice (again who is fourteen) had ordered all four desserts. Which to be fair she did ask for something to be brought out with a candle, maybe it was wrong to assume it was on the house but charging for four desserts seemed like taking advantage of us, especially since they informed no one of this and it was ordered by a child!<br>Additionally when I tried to explain this, the waiter became really rude and said that they had been so nice to us and &#39;even split the plate of two people that had been sharing&#39; which we agreed was really thoughtful but we did not ask for at all, and to make it worse they charged us for each plate they split without informing us it would be more expensive. Eventually they took off the dessert but not without making a scene and bad mouthing us to customers at the next table which was embarrassing.<br>Overall the service and food was okay but the deception and overcharging put a damper on the night, and ruined a birthday.

The DJ played a lot of old songs and old r&amp;b, with a small amount of new songs. Usually, I like it to be the other way around, but that&#39;s just personal preference. The food itself was also just ok. I think that $75 (per person-not including tax &amp; gratuity) for basic chicken and waffles and a bottle of mimosa is too much.

Don&#39;t get me wrong. Its nice but not exciting. I visited on a recent Saturday to celebrate one of my close friends&#39; birthday. Il Bastardo is located conveniently close to Hudson Yards. If you&#39;ve had a chance to see their instagram page, you&#39;ll notice lots of sparkle and celebrations. We went for their brunch event. When you walk in, there is a $5 mandatory coat check. Not sure why its&#39; mandatory because I saw quite a few men inside with their coats around their chairs. Once you walk into the establishment, it is dark with some LED lights, just like a night club, and the music was really loud. It didn&#39;t give me the typical brunch atmosphere I&#39;m used to. There are two sections, one on the main floor and another section just slightly above. I&#39;m guessing the lower section is really a dance floor with table situated there. It wasn&#39;t too packed when I arrived around 4:30pm. Very few people were dancing and there was a man dressed in a light-up robot suit, going around and entertaining everyone. <br><br>Once seated, we began to order. Il bastardo offers a pre-fixed option which I think is overpriced. Starting at $75, you get 1 entree and a full bottle of alcohol (e.g. champagne, sangria, mimosa etc). The menu offers a variety of American brunch classics and some lunch/dinner options such as, chicken and waffles, steak and eggs, french toast, etc. Depending on what you choose, it may cost you more. For my choice, I went with the crispy chicken sandwich which was an extra $10. For my drink, I chose a white sangria. When I think of a white sangria, I think of a mixed drink with fresh fruits. What I received was a bottle of Arbor Mist. Disappointing. I did not bother asking for something else, as I&#39;m not a drinker. I ended up sharing the bottle among the table. The food came within a reasonable time. The chicken sandwich was made quite well. Although small, the sandwich features a crispy fried chicken breast on a brioche bun, topped with some aioli sauce, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of avocado. It also came with a side of crispy fries in a decorative basket. Everything was tasty, prepared well, and at the right temperature however, the portion seemed a little small. My friends enjoyed their meals, no complaints. After our meal, we continued to order shots and other drinks. The staff came over twice with a happy birthday sign and sparklers to celebrate my friend. We brought a cake but they charge a plating fee per person, which my friend did not want to partake in. <br><br>Our reservation was from 3pm-6pm however, they will allow you to sit longer until they need the table. We were able to sit until about 8:30pm, which was nice. We spent the rest of our time afterward, at the bar. As time went on, the place began to get packed. It turned into a full on club. Women were taking their shoes off and twerking at their tables. Guys standing on the side taking photos with their friends. At one point, someone proposed to their loved one. Among all things, vaccination is required however, masks did not seem to be. People (except staff) were walking throughout the establishment without masks - in the bathroom, at the table, on the dance floor, everywhere. I wish they had enforced that a little more. The crowd seems to be mostly early to mid 20s of all ethnicities. The music is a blend of popular hip-hop, R&amp;B, and reggatone however, the DJ was not that great. Sometime he would play some great songs but transitioned poorly or cut the track too early. When we asked for a little Caribbean music, he played maybe 4 songs then went right back to hip-hop. We asked again once a different DJ came on board. He played the same songs the last DJ played but added maybe 3 more. Not enough variety in my opinion. Service was good. All of the staff are kind and attentive. No issues. <br><br>Overall, I didn&#39;t think this was an amazing experience. It was mediocre at best. Despite the food being good, I don&#39;t think it was $85 worth of good food, and that does not including tax or tip. Thats pretty expensive. I&#39;ve had a better time in Harlem at a boozy brunch, for that price. I hate that the pre-fixed option includes a full bottle of liquor for one person. I would rather the option of a mixed drink or an unlimited pitcher for the table. A bottle seems overwhelming. In addition, the vibe was not as upscale as I would expect for the area. I felt like I was at an 18+ party. As someone in their early 30s, this is not the spot if you&#39;re looking for good music and food with an occasional two step. So, 3 stars for good food and service.

Not sure how something is a carbonara without egg, pancetta or cheese. The sauce was akin to Campbell&#39;s tomato soup. The chicken was bland as if it was boiled then finished in an oven. Again, the theme of the night bland and flavorless. Osso bucco special at another table looked nice but hey they were sold out before 6 PM.

As such, I came with high expectations, expecting Il Florista to showcase the best of its flower offerings, but the flowers seem to be the afterthought.<br><br>My best friend and I arrived at Il Florista and were seated immediately for our reservation on a Friday<br>night (which we didn&#39;t need because the restaurant was far from full). We decided to order the chef&#39;s menu instead of the restaurant week menu in addition to the thorn in my side, suddenly last summer, butterfly kiss, and lavender pollinator cocktails.<br><br>We expected to be served 4 dishes but we were served 10 dishes (I&#39;m not complaining!). We were served the stracciatella, trout tartare, satsuma mandarin + dandelion greens, off-menu fussili, squid ink cavatelli, bread, salmon with beans, hangar steak, semifreddo, and a coconut sorbet with strawberries.<br><br>Starting with drinks:<br><br>- The thorn in my side cocktail was a perfect mix of sweet, floral, and refreshing without masking the taste of the mezcal. 10/10<br><br>- Suddenly last summer was beautifully presented but tasted very watered down. My best friend informed the waiter and he immediately replaced it with the butterfly kiss cocktail.<br><br>- The butterfly kiss cocktail was really sweet, and when the cocktail gets warm the sweetness is unbearable.<br><br>- The lavender pollinator cocktail was strong and the floral notes from the lavender complimented the gin very well. <br><br>Food highlights:<br><br>Stracciatella - the sweet green tomatoes and creamy straciatella mixed with the summer squash is great! Very light and refreshing and served with several seeded crackers.<br><br>Trout tartare toast - very flavorful and seasoned well. Great way to start our meal.<br><br>Off-menu fussili - the fussilli was coated in a lemon sauce with basil and cheese. When you&#39;re not expecting it, the lemon can be overwhelming at first. But the more you eat it, the better it gets. I wish they gave us two servings of this pasta.<br><br>The average:<br><br>Satsuma mandarin + dandelion greens - the combination of flavors is great but the balance isn&#39;t there. I find that there are too many dandelion greens without enough toppings. Since the dandelion greens are very bitter, if you don&#39;t have a bite of the greens with a piece of orange, goat cheese, or raisin, you&#39;re gonna regret it.<br><br>Bread - it&#39;s warm and fresh. The taste is fine, nothing to complain about. They also give you a lot.<br><br>Salmon with beans - the salmon is tender and the skin is crispy. The beans are served on the side. This tasted average.<br><br>Hangar steak - cooked to medium rare topped with corn, mint, and some unidentified leaves. The dish came together well with the sweetness of the corn and the refreshing mint complementing the beef. Pretty good but not a standout.<br><br>Coconut sorbet with strawberries - a mildly sweet end with a fruity finish. The coconut sorbet is creamy and light and the strawberries and fresh. The dark chocolate shavings are a nice touch. <br><br>The duds:<br><br>Squid ink cavatelli - this tasted fine and I liked the touch of fennel and saffron but there were a few issues with this dish. The cavatelli was slightly undercooked making the pasta a little chewy in addition to the calamari being slightly overcooked which creates the same problem. It would also be nice if the sauce was cooked for longer to bring out the flavors more. <br><br>Semmifreddo - the texture is very off-putting. There&#39;s an unpleasant graininess that is consistent throughout the dish. Even though the dessert tasted fine, the texture could not be overlooked.<br><br>Despite the rollercoaster quality of the food and drink, the service and atmosphere is impeccable. Our waiter was friendly and professional (similar to how the michelin star waitstaff are). Our waiter periodically came to check on us throughout our meal but was not overbearing. The waiter made sure that the suddenly last summer cocktail was taken off our check (since it was barely touched). The backdrop is chic bohemian and the noise level is reasonable. The style definitely matches the flowershop restaurant.<br><br>I think I would rate Il Florista a 3.5 but closer to 4 stars than 3.

It was exactly what I&#39;d think of when I imagine a floral gin drink and I really enjoyed it.<br>- For my second drink I had the English Rose; it had a very strong cherry flavor. Although this is was expected from the description, it was a bit of a strong flavor for me. <br><br>Food: All of my food was delicious! \u00a0<br>- Tumeric sourdough with sunflower petal spice olive oil - HIGHLY recommend. This was probably the most delicious bread I have ever had. I would go back just for this bread alone. The outside of the bread was crispy but the inside was perfectly chewy and soft. The dipping oil was perfectly complementary as well; the flavors blended so nicely. <br>- Pappardelle with lemon and lavender: I really enjoyed the pasta. I was nervous after reading some of the reviews that it was tough, but I found it to be perfectly cooked. My only complaint was that I wish the portion size was bigger (particularly for the price). I found the flavors to be really unique; the cheese melted perfectly into the lemon sauce while the lavender added a fun twist. All of the flavors blended perfectly and didn&#39;t find any to be too overwelming.<br>- Bombolone: I had really been looking forward to the chocolate cake, but since they were out, I was convinced to try the bombolone. It was essentially a warm donut hole with apple compote inside and a creme dipping sauce. They weren&#39;t super unique but very tasty!<br><br>Service / Ambience: I sat at the bar and even though he was constantly making drinks, the bartender was attentive and quick. Also, even though the chair didn&#39;t have a back, it was actually really comfortable. Overall, it was a super cute restaurant - very trendy and chic.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 118, "reviewCount": 53, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "3/21/2022", "comment": {"text": "Simple and elegant is how I would describe Il Fiorista.<br><br>Every dish also a floral note to it, which for someone who loves flowers, I think is a great motif.

I got a great rate on a hotel room and was all set for a weekend full of museum visits and some outdoor meals with friends. <br><br>Two hours before tonight&#39;s meal, my friend texted to say his wife had potential Covid symptoms. Of course I had no problem with him cancelling (better to find out beforehand), but there went my dinner plans. So I checked into my room and headed to a place that looked good on Yelp. They told me all their tables were spoken for but I could check back in an hour. I told them I&#39;d look around. A few other places didn&#39;t look inviting or have distanced outdoor dining. Then I came across Il Fiorista. \u00a0What a sight for someone who hasn&#39;t eaten at a restaurant since the fall! The inside was beautiful, spacious and so tastefully decorated. A wonderful touch is that it&#39;s also a flower shop, as it&#39;s name in Italian implies. You can even get some flowers and gifts for home. Floral ingredients are featured in each dish. <br><br>Thursday through Saturday they offer a chef&#39;s tasting menu ($75 for 4 courses or $59 for 3) or \u00e0 la carte options. I choose the tasting menu. After 5 months, it was time to live it up!<br><br>I started with the salted cod brandade over Focaccia. The fish is whipped with potatoes, garlic, and olive oil and spread over the crusty bread. It&#39;s as delicious as it sounds and a welcome change from the usual starters. It was served with greens.<br><br>Up next was a house-made pasta with basil and sunflower cooked and seasoned to perfection and topped with sunflower petals. Another perfect dish. This really was like being on a trip to Italy yet I was only 90 minutes from home!!<br><br>The sea scallops were impeccably prepared and plated along with scallions, corn, and baby onions atop a green garlic sauce and lightly sprinkled with tiny saffron flowers. Just magical!! <br><br>I finished my magnificent meal with the tiramisu. The waiter, who was excellent, told me it was a must-try. Made with rhubarb, pistachio and elderflower, this is not your grandma&#39;s tiramisu. The flavors do come together wonderfully atop bits of lady fingers which retain much more texture than those soaked in the restaurant staple. <br><br>If you go with a party of two or more you can book one of their greenhouses, just the spot to enjoy wonderful dishes inflected with floral touches. The food was outstanding with service to match. I&#39;m so, so glad I ate here, it was the balm I needed after a long winter. I highly recommend it for a much-needed night out. <br><br>On the way back to my hotel I noticed the table at the first place was still empty.

I don&#39;t think the Pappardelle would be enough as a main for one person if you didn&#39;t add a couple apps as well. As long as you that know going in, and can order a couple other items, you won&#39;t regret it. The dish is incredible. <br><br>The entire restaurant concept is really so unique and well thought out. The idea of infusing floral aspects into the food, drinks, hands-on classes, etc. is awesome, and they pair this with a major focus on sustainability and eco-friendly practices.

Somehow, almost everything about this place is simultaneously terrible.<br> <br>Service<br>* The waiters were pushy and started asking us if we were ready to order two minutes after sitting down. They would then come back every two minutes after that. When we went, the restaurant was not full. <br>* We sent a food item back because it was foul and still got charged for it<br> <br>Food<br>Let&#39;s start with the yakitori. This place is apparently known for it, and I think this is your best bet. The chicken tsukune (meatball) is pretty good. I didn&#39;t try any of their other skewers (see section re: price/value below). However, for a place that prides themselves on yakitori the selection is painfully mediocre; I would&#39;ve liked to see items more befitting a yakitori specialty shop like chicken oyster, heart/liver/gizzard, cartilage, and seafood (shrimp/scallops). If I somehow have the misfortune of eating here again, I&#39;d stick to skewers only. <br> <br>Besides the chicken tsukune, the Purple Sweet Potato Fries were the second best, followed by the Chicken Karaage and Ebi Mayo. Yes, the non-yakitori item I was most impressed by was fried potatoes. Still, their fried food could use a little less breading across the board.<br> <br>Everything else ranged from &#34;I might literally get food poisoning&#34; to &#34;Just okay&#34;. By rank order from worst to best we ordered<br>* Cured Salmon Rice Ball with Ikura &amp; Uni. Uni looked discolored and mushy/watery. Tasted equivalently bad (bitter / funky). We sent this back because we didn&#39;t want to risk food poisoning.<br>* Hokke (Grilled mackerel). Tasted like salt and was super dry. If you&#39;re looking for a similar flavor profile at home, I&#39;d recommend eating miso paste straight from the container. <br>* Okonomiyaki. Tasted fine. I couldn&#39;t really taste the seafood, but fried batter + kewpie mayo carried it to the mediocre tier.<br>* Teriyaki Ika. This was just okay. They get points for the chewy texture and the slight char. But they need to chill with the teriyaki sauce.<br> <br>Price/Value<br>This is mainly knocking their yakitori menu. Per skewer, expect to spend $5-10. Calling out specifics, $10 for chicken tsukune and $5 for chicken thigh is highway robbery, even for NYC. Places that I&#39;ve been to (in the same neighborhood and in the same week as the writing of this review) with far better yakitori in terms of taste and variety charge on average about 30% less for comparable skewers.

He marked it with his Initials I think.<br>When A and I got there as we were early, we couldn&#39;t find the host/hostess. We kind of stood there awkwardly waiting for someone to help us out. Eventually the hostess came and sat us in the back part of the restaurant, where it kind of feels like the outside but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an open space area with a lot of light and it&#39;s a really beautiful area. <br><br>As an aside, the decoration is gorgeous and the ambience is that of any Italian restaurant in Little Italy - busy, but the staff are still attentive. <br><br>Back to the food, when my BIL and his BF arrived, they gave us bread and ordered glasses of wine. Food wise, A got the chicken parm, BIL&#39;s BF got the chicken fillet, BIL got the penne vodka (which is what we predicted he would get), and I got the pasta with their special made sauce that is only done on weekends. I didn&#39;t realize my BIL&#39;s BF didn&#39;t like mushrooms so he pushed all the mushrooms to the side and ate the chicken. I picked at his mushrooms here and there because I like mushrooms a lot. But my dish was amazing. It went well with whatever wine I had gotten and the sauce was amazing: it has meatballs, spare ribs, sausage, and braciola in it. It&#39;s difficult to tell in the picture because only the meatball shows but the other meats are buried under the sauce. I didn&#39;t think I would finish but I surprisingly did. I think we all finished our dish for the most part and we were all so stuffed.

I didn&#39;t eat the cannoli because I&#39;m not a cannoli fan but the cheesecakes and red velvet cakes were so good. Even though we were all full, we managed to eat dessert. <br><br>To summarize: great food, good service, lovely interior and atmosphere.

Naturally, being the good Yelp Elite I am, I wanted to take them to some of the best New York City has to offer, and in particular somewhere with Italian-American food. Il Cortile came recommended by my friend (who has excellent taste), so I went ahead and made a reservation for 7pm on Friday.<br><br>Upon arrival (about 15 minutes early), we were greeted and seated. Unfortunately, once we were seated, we were greeted by the dreaded QR code menu rather than an actual paper menu. While this isn&#39;t something that bothers me, it was very difficult for my parents to read the menu on the phone. Later in the evening, I noticed that paper menus were in fact available, but not presented to us (we did not realize it was an option). Frankly, I was ready to condemn this place right here: while QR codes made sense during Covid, there&#39;s simply no reason to use them for menus any longer, and certainly not at a restaurant with an ambience any nicer than McDonalds. While using QR codes may save money for the restaurant owner, so does removing toilet paper from the bathroom (which is a bad idea). Even worse is that the linked menu was a PDF that used a &#34;fancy&#34; font, and not optimized for mobile, making an already difficult to read menu even harder on my parents, particularly my father. While we were trying to figure out the menu, the tension was raised just a bit by the roving accordion player who seemed to want us to tip him to play (I&#39;d rather tip him not to). We did not appreciate it, but any accordion fans will likely enjoy this touch of ambience.<br><br>Once we were able to figure out what the restaurant served, we made our orders and relaxed: the hard part was over. Our bottle of wine came out and was acceptable, and then it was time for food.<br><br>First, we had ordered the antipasto platter. It was pretty much what you would expect from an antipasto platter, with a collection of meats and cheeses and various accoutrement. Nothing special, but it started the meal off on the right foot. We skipped salad, but it looks like the Caesar is made table side (at least at other tables), which is always a good sign.<br><br>Our mains came out after a little while (not overly long of a wait, but not too soon either). I ordered the linguine cicale, which is basically a seafood pasta similar to dishes I&#39;ve had in the past and a favorite of mine. The seafood was cooked well, with the always-tricky octopus coming in not over cooked, always an accomplishment. The sauce was also quite pleasant. My mother ordered the cheese ravioli, and quite enjoyed it, with the sauce again serving as a highlight (it was remarkably fresh tasting). Finally, my father had the Chicken Scarpariello. The dish was very generously portioned, and my father seemed to enjoy, with his primary complaint being that the dish was far too much for him to eat in one sitting (overall a good thing). It didn&#39;t seem particularly appealing to me but that is simply preference.<br><br>Finally, we had the bomba for dessert. The gelato was exceptionally good, and even my father (who was stuffed from his main course, see above) enjoyed it very much. <br><br>Shortly after we received the bill, which came out to a couple hundred dollars. Overall, the value for money was solid, but there are certainly ways they could have improved the experience (particularly the menu issue above). I wouldn&#39;t say that this is my new &#34;go-to&#34; for visitors, but you could certainly do worse, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be as much of a tourist trap as some other Little Italy Italian restaurants.

Eventually we flagged someone down and we were immediately seated - but in another part of the restaurant, not the garden room. So that was a bit upsetting. We were given some bread and breadsticks with butter - which was subpar.

Incredible and prompt service through and through. I really appreciated how our server split our appetizers for us on our plate, and the same thing with our main courses.

Mala beef is beef saut\u00e9ed with Szechuan peppercorns, which have a mouth numbing spiciness to it. It&#39;s a different experience you get from eating Jalape\u00f1os or Thai chilis.

It also doesn&#39;t come with chips to dip in, you&#39;ll need to order this for an additional price.<br>Oysters: Standard east coast oysters. A little pricy ($18). The sauce for topping was nice and spicy!<br>Birria Tacos: These were tasty. The meat was tender and the consomm\u00e9 on the side was amazing. A little disappointed that it only came with two for the price.<br>Pollo Rostizado: The chicken was a little dry but the mole sauce was really good. <br>Elote: SO GOOD! They give a decent-sized portion. Would highly recommend as a side to share with the sable.<br>Papas Bravas: We also really enjoyed these.

There&#39;s nothing like a fresh ricotta and this one has a good balance of flavors and textures with the fresh grapes and radish shavings. The Gamberi were perfectly cooked and not over-seasoned, so that you could really appreciate their freshness. <br><br>The ribs and octopus, however, left much to be desired. I have high expectations at this price point for a grilled octopus dish to be cooked well. Everyone knows overcooking octopus gives it an unpleasant, rubbery texture, so why serve overcooked octopus at the three-dollar sign price point? Should be as easy as removing it from the grill, no? Same critique for the ribs - overcooked. They also come over a sauce that I believe adds nothing to the dish. <br><br>Onto the main courses - I tasted all the pastas on the menu that night - truffle linguine, the torchio with pork shoulder, and the spaghetti with gamberi. Each was decent. You can tell the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente. My torchio was the best in my opinion. I love an al dente pasta and the pork shoulder pieces were plentiful and perfectly cooked, with a very good flavor. <br><br>The truffle pasta was a bit disappointing. For almost $50 I expected the strong flavor and aroma of truffles that normally fills the restaurant when ordered. The pasta came with a generous amount of truffles but they taste like normal mushrooms. Not sure if it&#39;s me not knowing good truffles or if it&#39;s more that these are cheaper mushrooms. IMO not worth $50. <br><br>The shrimp spaghetti is a solid choice. Not much to critique or complement for that. <br><br>The desserts are good. I had the panna cotta which comes topped with a balsamic reduction. This is a new flavor combination for me. I am not sure I enjoyed it but I could see someone else enjoying that combination.

It came with two kinds - a white and wheat - but I didn&#39;t like either. My husband thought they were okay. You can buy the olive oil at their sister restaurant around the corner (Il Buco Alimento). I was very tempted to buy some.<br>- Bikini (9/10): These were amazing mini sandwiches with homemade mozzarella, truffle, and iberico. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night - a little greasy but so tasty - highly recommend.<br>- Kale salad (7/10): The black Tuscan kale was good and I loved the taste of the Parmesan but the croutons were so hard that they were inedible.<br>- Truffle Tagliatelle (10/10): it is a little buttery as some reviews suggest but I didn&#39;t find it off putting. We loved the texture of the pasta and there was a great amount of truffle.<br>- Orecchiette (8/10): I found the pasta texture was a little tough and difficult to chew but my husband (who says I like mushy pasta and that I probably just don&#39;t like al dente) thought it was good. I also wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the meat with it but I did enjoy the brightness of the peppers, which was a nice touch. Not sure I would order it again though.<br>- Flourless chocolate cake (6/10). I would skip this. It was fine but nothing special. I have definitely had better.

He has a really interesting story, and his restaurant makes really delicious food.

They were able to seat me where I wanted on the counter, even though the restaurant was quite busy. And it was busy for a good reason. <br><br>The ambience is Japanese-style comic book (not Manga, the western-style comic book). It&#39;s a fun and unpretentious vibe, but with a lot of thought behind the decor, and the flatware/silverware. <br><br>I started my meal with the Kyuri (cucumber pickles). They were well-made, but beware, they&#39;re quite spicy. Consider yourself warned. <br><br>My friend had the pork buns. He really liked them, but s not as good at describing food as I am. The buns were not spicy, but he said one of the garnishes inside it was. He did not consider the dish itself to be spicy, and he said he thought it tasted really good. <br><br>The crispy eggplant was incredible - probably my favorite dish of the meal. The coating on the eggplant was crispy, but the eggplant itself was tender - perfectly cooked. It came on top of a delicious sesame sauce. It felt reminiscent of the Japanese &#34;goma nasubi&#34; dish, but with a New York twist. I loved the dish and would order it again. That said, (suggestion based on personal preference - not a criticism) it would be cool if the sauce came inside the eggplant instead of underneath. Cutting the eggplant would let it cool down faster, and the sauce being on the inside would make eating it a different experience. <br><br>The ramen itself is not your traditional Japanese ramen - but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. The chef mixes rye flour into the noodles, giving it an interesting texture. The noodles come firm at first, but soften up as they sit in the broth. They don&#39;t feel particularly springy, but are still a delight to eat. The broth itself was probably the best ramen broth I have tasted in my life - the umami was strong, but the broth did not leave you dying of thirst after having it. I also really appreciated the grilled tomato - it was something different - it tasted almost Italian. <br><br>It&#39;s apparent that although this restaurant is a ramen spot, and celebrates the 20 years Ivan spent living in Japan, the restaurant does not purport to be 100% traditionally Japanese. Instead, while being firmly rooted in proper Japanese cuisine, I appreciate how each dish also brings in an element of Ivan&#39;s New York heritage. For example, while the Kyuri is a traditional Japanese appetizer, the pickles were more akin to NY deli pickles, and while the ramen looks traditional to the ye, the noodles contain rye flour - a testament to Ivan&#39;s background (I learned the rye part from the Chef&#39;s table episode). <br><br>The food is delicious, and each dish tells a story.

But I reallllly like salt most of the time, and it was about a thousand times too much for me. When they pickled the mustard greens and the wood ear mushrooms, is it possible they just poured the pickling water into my soup? It was medicinally salty, chemically so. I could smell it when they put the bowl down - I picked the bowl up to sniff it curiously before I even lifted a spoon to my mouth.<br><br>If ratings were an average of how well each ingredient was prepared, Ivan would have done okay, actually.

Came here a few months back and it was packed on a Wednesday afternoon. The wait time was around 15 minutes and we were seated at the back of the restaurant, tucked into a corner. Interior is heavy on the wooden accents and very cozy (read: depending on where you&#39;re sitting, you could be practically elbow to elbow with your neighbor).<br>Right off the bat, I would say to skip the appetizers. We got the recommended kara-age and truffle fries, both underwhelming. Five pieces of chicken-nugget-esque chunks arrived in front of us garnished with a lemon wedge and two shishito peppers. It was.. bad. I bit into a solid chunk of batter which was not cooked through. The second bite was not much better, as there was an excess of untrimmed fat. Honestly, the highlight of this was the mentaiko mayo dipping sauce which we kept for the fries. Speaking of, the truffle fries were a joke as well. The &#39;truffle paste&#39; was dumped haphazardly over the shoestring-style fries, which meant you were either wrestling to spread it with another fry, eating one with nothing on it, or getting a chunk of the salty paste. Some of the fries were perfect but a greater portion felt like we were biting into oil (you can see in the picture how thoroughly soaked the parchment paper was on one side touching the fries). The ridiculous upcharge on apps would have been more negligible had the food quality actually been on par with the price.<br><br>Now for the redeeming qualities, and why people actually come to Ippudo:<br>The ramen is fantastic, there&#39;s no argument here. <br>Karaka Spicy- rich tonkotsu broth with al dente thin noodles, perfect for clinging onto the soup. The drizzle of garlic oil and dollop of spicy paste completely transforms the flavor of the broth so I usually have a few bites and sipes before mixing everything together. <br>Yuzu Shoyu- this pork-free soy-sauce based broth was surprising not as light as I expected it to be. It tasted very strongly of the bonito fish dashi, but not in an unpleasant way. The noodles used are a thicker wavy variety which provided an interesting texture. The yuzu was fragrant and gave the ramen a nice citrus aftertaste. Everything worked very well together in this bowl.<br>Lastly, we also got Lychee 75, a cocktail that packs a punch.

When we entered, there&#39;s a small bar looking area, which is the waiting area and apparently, not an actual bar area. They didn&#39;t take reservations, so when we went in, we waited to put our name down and check on the wait. The hostess was very flippant and unconcerned with helping anyone. She wasn&#39;t even at her post when some people were coming in, so it was a weird situation of people awkwardly standing around waiting to see what the deal was. <br><br>When she finally could be bothered, she turned to the groups waiting and asks the customers the order in which they&#39;d all arrived. Insane. Some people had been waiting for a while and we&#39;re just passed right over. \u00a0<br><br>We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. We figured, okay, we can maybe leave and come back - since it was getting a bit crowded, but they didn&#39;t call or text people when tables were ready, so we had to wait. We then thought, okay, we could have a drink or something in the meantime. Nope. The hostess said we couldn&#39;t order any drinks until we were seated. Odd that they&#39;d have a bar are in front then, hm?<br><br>When we were finally seated, we&#39;d obviously had more than enough time to think about what we were going to order, so wanted to get that out of the way asap instead of waiting for servers to go back and forth and eventually come back our way. We ordered appetizers (bao buns) and drinks and our ramen. Our bao buns came out - they tasted okay, but I didn&#39;t really love how sweet the dressing was on mine. Our ramen came out. We were halfway through our meal and still ... no drinks? We flagged someone down - and guess what? They&#39;d completely forgotten to bring our drinks or put in the order. Awesome. <br><br>I ordered the yuzu Shoyu ramen and my husband got the karaka spicy ramen. I asked for mine to also be spicy - which they didn&#39;t do for some reason. When I asked for chili oil or some sort of hot sauce, apparently that&#39;s extra, so they gave me togaroshi flakes which I guess was fine. <br><br>Neither my husband nor I enjoyed our ramen. The portions were fine, but the ramen itself - left so much to be desired. They were both pretty flavorless and the broths were strangely light. The noodles were thin and not really that nice Al dente you&#39;d typically hope for. <br><br>I really didn&#39;t have a great experience at all, I barely ate the ramen, the service was really negligent. I definitely don&#39;t think the entire thing was worth our 30 minute wait.

The French fries ($8) were actually pretty good though, as they seasoned them well, although they didn&#39;t give any ketchup with it.<br><br>The place is quite small, as there are only around 5 tables inside. Luckily, there weren&#39;t many others in there when we went. Given most of the food is already pre-prepared / essentially ready to go, the service speed is pretty quick. The staff are average friendliness. The vibes are definitely on the casual side, as I wouldn&#39;t exactly call the interior environment nice- not that it was necessary dirty or anything, just could use a bit of sprucing up.<br><br>Overall, I think this place could be fine for delivery/take-out or if you are just looking to grab a quick Turkish bite.

We had ordered food at the bar and they brought it to our table. <br><br>The table we were seated at had dirty glasses and cutlery. <br><br>I&#39;ll spare the rest, but needless to say, we left as quickly as possible and went to a nearby Irish pub where the service was impeccable and the food, much better. \u00a0<br><br>Who would&#39;ve thought an Irish pub would save the day on Cinco de Mayo. \u00a0<br><br>Ps- never met the hostess who was MIA even when we left. I hope she gets some good R&amp;R and comes back refreshed-- and I genuinely mean that. Clearly she was so overwhelmed, there should&#39;ve been at least another hostess to fill in. <br><br>Wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if this was 2021 and we were only a year post-pandemic. <br><br>But no excuse to run an establishment this way, in 2023 in midtown on Cinco de Mayo. <br><br>Do better next time for those that come back. I won&#39;t be one of them. \u00a0<br><br>Ps- still tipped 20% because those that did care enough to serve us were kind. \u00a0They deserve it. <br><br>PPS: there were EMPTY TABLES that were reserved and none of them filled with lines waiting still out the door.

The edamame and takoyaki was just what one would expect; nothing to write home about, but reliable in which one would get and taste what they would expect.\u00a0 I enjoyed the appetizers, which was great because...<br><br>The kitchen was slow.\u00a0 For the sort of dishes that were prepared, the wait was longer than what I would have liked and kept me from ordering more.\u00a0 For what it&#39;s worth, the food came out looking pretty and neatly plated, but given that the restaurant bills itself as an izakaya, the speed should be pub-like (you know, like, you&#39;re out with the boys, you got some beers in you and you want to eat as soon as possible) and I would have easily forgone the presentation if it had meant the food would come out faster.\u00a0 I chalked up the lack of speed to the restaurant being new and as it gels together and streamlines its operations, I don&#39;t think this will be an issue going forward.<br><br>We ordered a few mains to share amongst the group, including two orders of the premium sushi &amp; sashimi combos that cost $95 (9/9: corrected to reflect the proper price per receipt) per order.\u00a0 Each combo included sashimi staples (e.g. salmon, tuna, snapper, etc.), with two pieces of each fish and two additional rolls, that came out carefully plated on a visually impressive staircase-shaped platform.\u00a0 The fish was fresh and tasted good.\u00a0 The salmon, for example, was rich and buttery.\u00a0 Notably, the mackerel did not have the fishy, almost pungent taste I expected from this fish, nor did it strongly taste of marinade, which I was very impressed with.\u00a0 Especially because of its visual flair, the premium sushi &amp; sashimi combo is definitely a *splash* order someone looking to impress their date. With that being said, while one combo is a sufficient amount of food for two persons, one would want to supplement an order of this with a small plate or two.<br><br>Our orders also included a beef kimchi fried rice and a salmon &amp; ikura don, which I tried.\u00a0 The beef kimchi fried rice was Japanese-style, so the texture was a good deal softer.\u00a0 The rice was cooked nicely, but could have included a little more kimchi and beef to feel more substantial.\u00a0 The beef could have also been sliced into smaller pieces so there would be an even distribution of beef in each spoonful.\u00a0 The salmon &amp; ikura don was good (no surprise as I had enjoyed the salmon that came out in the combo just a moment ago), though I would have wanted more ikura because the amount present made the ikura look more like a garnish than an actual part of the dish.<br><br>We were also given a sample platter of desserts on the house to enjoy at the end of our meal consisting of mochi ice cream and brownies, all of which was delicious.\u00a0 The desserts obviously are not a signature element of the \u00a0establishment, but it was a very thoughtful gesture by the restaurant that I very much appreciate.<br><br>When divided between the group, the dinner cost ~$57 per person, including tax and tip. While not a bargain, the price is more acceptable when taking into consideration that the restaurant is located in a pricey and touristy part of Midtown and the level of service that we were given throughout our meal.<br><br>All in all, I had a great time eating here and look forward to seeing how the restaurant is later on in the future.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 391, "reviewCount": 145, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "9/8/2023", "comment": {"text": "Came here for my friends birthday and the restaurant itself isn&#39;t busy for a Friday night. Initial thought was, they don&#39;t have their liquor license and they&#39;re new, so not many are aware of here. Later on when the food came...a number of us begin to realize there may be a different reason behind the lack of customers. <br>Before I get to the food, wait service is fine, however kitchen is extremely slow, considering there are many empty tables around. It takes around 20 to 30 minutes just for food to come out. Had the restaurant been busy, I can understand why it takes so long. <br>We ordered the brussel sprouts which was pretty good, the sushi and sashimi for two, which I am highly disappointed at. For nearly $100, it is not worth it. Honestly, I&#39;ve had better sushi at an ayce place. We also ordered three maki rolls: eel avocado + cucumber, tuna roll and spicy crab salad. This is pretty much standard everywhere, however the size of the pieces were inconsistant. Each piece of sushi was unevenly cut, whereas the pieces kept getting smaller down the roll. We had also placed a few orders of calamari, neither were consistant. The second time it came out, there was too much salt. We also had their kimchi fried rice with beef..lets just say there&#39;s room for improvement. Presentation of the sushi was nice tho.<br>What appeared to be the owner/manager kept managing the waitstaff, which is fine, but it didn&#39;t look too well in front of the customers. <br>Granted this place is still new, there is much to improve on. <br>They had also given a dessert sampler on the house for us to try. It included their mochi ice cream and brownie. The mochi ice creams were really good, which makes me believe it&#39;s made in-house or of the sort. The mango mochi ice cream actually tasted like real fruit and not artificial. The black sesame mochi is also good if you like the taste of black sesame. The greentea was alright. The outer layer of the mochi was easy to cut through and soft. So you can definitely try them out.<br>At some point, there was a lot of water shoe prints around the kitchen and bathroom area in the back. They need to work on keeping the floors dry in the halls and the bathroom.<br>If they work out all the kinks, perhaps it&#39;s worth trying out again.

My friend who hadn&#39;t prepaid purchased a combo, jerk pork and jerk chicken with two roast corns.

If you decide to do so, be prepared to be seated in very tight spacing as well as being hunched over to eat on low tables for their outdoor seating. \u00a0Their outdoor seating party couples or a party of 4 be prepared to be placed in uncomfortable seating which are plastic chairs or plastic bar stools with no back support. Number one the front of the restaurant has bags of garbage to the side of it from another business, along with an abandoned outdoor seating probably left over from the pandemic. Inside, The indoor seating smells like either mold or very bad plumbing along with very limited seating so there is also the option of sitting out back where the ambiance seems like a backyard party. Literally! I came here with a group of six and they gave us the option of sitting at an area with one square table for six people or another area with three tables. But the space was very tight. Logically, we opted to sit in the area with three tables but there was no space for legroom and I had no idea how they expected us to eat. I guess hunched over or eating on our laps. \u00a0Seems like there are a bunch of young individuals, starting out, working here. The customer service is not the best, although the wait staff is friendly. Drinks took forever to come. The water tastes like tap water. Friends did order bottomless mimosas which they are happy with what they ordered and I ordered a Mai Tai which was delicious and actually tasted like alcohol more than syrup. I ordered sweet chili Thai wings along with a hamburger and fries. The wings were decent. Flavor was great but my fries tasted like They weren&#39;t homemade and very mushy like they weren&#39;t cooked long enough. My burger, whatever sauce they used on it was heavily doused on both buns to the point of it making the bottom bun soggy and causing my burger to fall apart. I really couldn&#39;t enjoy it but nonetheless the burger was good. Also, they automatically add a 20% gratuity charge to a party of more than four which I don&#39;t think they deserve. It is what it is, but this is not a place I would come back to and a place I do not recommend. Also be prepared, just a side note, to sweat as they only had one working fan and no ventilation as you are enclosed in some type of plastic roofing entrapment.

I entered the 24-hour eatery before 8 am, and there were 6 people eating at 2 out of the 25 tables, and yet the first thing the waitress/seater said to me was that I couldn&#39;t sit down until the friend I was meeting there arrived. <br><br>I am disabled and all I wanted was a cup of coffee and to read the newspaper as I waited (I wasn&#39;t sure when he would get there as he&#39;s not the most punctual friend) but she wouldn&#39;t allow that.

And yes, in my opinion, IHOP is fast food; there&#39;s not one iota of craftsmanship or pride to be found behind the counter, and cookie cutter meals are pumped out with the same concern people flip a 2 ounce patty onto a stale bun.

Instead, I told the manager I would return the food, and they could either re-fire it or credit my card for the meal.

We began our breakfast at midnight by splitting a cookies and cream milkshake 3 ways (a perfect portion) and it was spectacular. The cookies were fresh and perfectly crunchy while the ice cream tasted like it came straight from the udder and provided a wonderful creamy base. We could not have asked for a better sweet treat!<br><br>Shaunte helped us order an appropriate amount of food for three moderately-hungry young women looking for fried food and carbs. We ordered the appetizer and breakfast samplers with an additional pancake so our group could have one pancake each (thanks for the tip, Shaunte!). <br><br>One would think that the International House of Pancakes might be lacking expertise in the appetizer department. One would be wrong. The onion rings were perfectly crisp, the mozzarella sticks stringy, and the chicken tenders were just as tender as one could hope.

The waitstaff also was very attentive when we ordered, and food was brought out quickly. No complaints here!<br><br>Environment: 3/5 in the day, 4/5 at night? <br>We came at 12:00 ish on a Saturday and had the whole restaurant to ourselves. When you enter, there&#39;s a relatively long walkway/entryway before you get to the host/check in point. It doesn&#39;t make very much sense during the day, but I can see how at night it would be perfect to wait around when the place gets crowded. Inside the restaurant, there&#39;s two floors of seating as well as a bar. The entire interior is black, making it extremely dark. There is a large mirror at the very back with some lights that is reminiscent of a club. When you sit down, the chairs and tables are not as &#34;luxe&#34; as its environment (metal chairs). They also give a fork and knife wrapped up in a nice cloth napkin, which was surprising. At an izakaya place (more bar like food), chopsticks is the preferred method (+ paper napkins). The bathroom also had an all black interior with gold fixtures. Overall, the environment of the place screams luxe speakeasy, an interesting vibe for an izakaya with late night bar snacks. \u00a0<br><br>Food<br>We ordered three drinks, three appetizers and two entrees to share amongst 3 people, which was a good amount of food, if not too much.<br><br>For the drinks we got the cocktails in the peach, grapefruit and lychee flavors. Peach definitely tasted like watered down peach soju, the grapefruit was tart while providing enough of a kick, and the lychee was pretty sweet/sugary.

It was definitely on the oilier side, but a great snack. The mayo sauce was okay, and could&#39;ve used the other flavors, as all I could mainly taste was mayo/cream. The karaage also came in big pieces as well as a dipping sauce. However, we weren&#39;t too impressed as the dipping sauce was just a teriyaki/sweet dark sauce; we found the dipping sauce to be too sweet, it could&#39;ve used a mayo/aioli sauce instead (I ended up dipping it in the agedashi sauce or mayo sauce)Additionally, the karaage itself came in rather bigger pieces, leaving it to be on the drier side. The breading wasn&#39;t as crispy as we would&#39;ve liked, and wasn&#39;t as flavorful. The agedashi tofu was great; the sauce had ginger and scallions, and the tofu had a great &#34;skin layer.&#34; Perfect for sopping up the delicious, light sauce.<br><br>As for entrees, we got the pork katsudon and the deluxe/combo udon soup. \u00a0<br>Pork katsudon: 3.5/5<br>Deluxe/udon: 3.5/5<br><br>The entrees were pretty standard, nothing stood out to us that much.

I&#39;ve had this before, it&#39;s a typical western Japanese dish. Literally a hamburger patty with a sweet and tangy sauce on top. The demi-glac\u00e9 was great! People who&#39;ve never had it before describe it as a ketchup/bbq mashup. That is exactly how it should be. It&#39;s supposed to be sweet, salty and tangy. Authentic. My only ding is I think they accidentally cooked my Hamburg a little too long so it wasn&#39;t juicy. It had a bit of too charred flavor to it and to cover it up I think they put extra sauce on it which was what I wanted anyway lol. Salad was good, basically mixed greens with kewpie sesame dressing (I think). Sticky rice was good to eat with the patty and sauce. <br><br>Karaage:<br>I&#39;m not gonna lie, after opening this I was not expecting much. It was extremely soggy looking since the steam had condensed in the packaging. I squeezed some lemon on it and dug in. It was still BOMB. Such flavorful and juicy chicken. Yes bits of the skin was soggy but it wasn&#39;t as soggy as it looked. The flavor was still there. I ordered a side of garlic sauce and it was a perfect accompaniment. It&#39;s basically a roasted garlic type sauce. Amazing garlic flavor and I couldn&#39;t figure out what else was in it.

There is a lot of staff here so you never feel neglected. <br><br>Environment - A large format, high-ceiling, warmly, and dimly, lit space made to provide a calm, intimate atmosphere while you dine. Tones, a mix of light and dark woods, adds on to the calming effect. The ambiance, and clientele, gave a shared sense luxury that would make me put it in the fine dining box. <br><br>Assessment/Plan:<br>Ilili is an excellent restaurant for large groups that don&#39;t mind spending an extra dime or two for the environment and service to justify the markup in prices. It&#39;s a fantastic restaurant that elevates an immigrant cuisine and showcases items that are hard to come by. It&#39;s good for loud, rowdy groups and for intimate dates.

We sat in the outdoor dinning area upstairs on a Friday night. The pros: above average comfort bar food with a twist and bouncers plus servers alike are friendly. The cons: this place tries to do too much both in the food and music department. They &#34;try&#34; hard with Dominican fusion on the menu and American while also having a DJ to turn the bar and grill into a club. I will have ambiance be the first category and food second instead for that reason. <br><br>Ambiance: N/A<br>This really depends on what you are looking for. If you were thinking loud bar plus hookah on top of liquor and border lining dance club with food, then this is your place. The music is loud and there are speakers outdoor too \u00a0(at least upstairs outdoor) so you can hear announcements from the radio and hear the music the DJ is playing in the main dinning area<br><br>Food: 3.7 out of 5<br>Wings in Thai flavor <br>Perfect amount of sweetness with a hint of spicy. The wings are over fried, but you cannot tell because there&#39;s enough Thai sauce to cover it<br>French fries<br>The fries weren&#39;t crunchy but flavorful and slightly soggy. The food came out really fast, so it makes me think these fries were already fried and left sitting<br>Grilled Octopus Salad<br>Again, our food got to us very quickly, so I feel like they had boiled or steam the octopus ahead of time, but did not grill it enough when I actually ordered. The &#34;dipping sauce&#34; is melted butter. There wasn&#39;t much flavor to tasted. The first .15 was los there<br>Lava cake<br>Although your typical bar dessert, the bundt cake is not too sweet even with the chocolate syrup on top so it definitely is above average. The con: they give you so little ice cream. I mean little, little that you end up eating 30% of your bundt cake w/out ice cream. Use the 4 slices of strawberry to pair at that point<br>Flan<br>This is a thick and heavy flan. If you expect a jello-like consistency, this is not it. It&#39;s dense but not creamy, which is slightly confusing. Tasty, but too sweet. The second .15 was lost here<br><br>Service: 4 out of 5<br>Our server was beyond friendly in an otherwise mad environment. Imagine 3 dinning areas: main, main outdoor, downstairs outdoor with really drunk people and loud music. The dessert did take almost 20 minutes to get to us, so I am not sure if our sever forgot our order or the kitchen took extra long warming up a bundt cake?<br><br>Price: 4 out of 5<br>$63 total before tip. After tip, it&#39;s $75. That&#39;s 2 appetizers: wings and octopus salad, 1 side: fries, and 2 desserts: lava cake and flan<br><br>Cleanliness: 4 out of 5<br>The outdoor tables weren&#39;t unclean, but they didn&#39;t look spot clean.

For our appetizer we love grilled seafood so decided to order grilled octopus. <br><br>You will receive only TWO pieces of gigantic grilled octopus tentacles there with a lot of salad on the side, so beware about that.

The dressing on the salad was good too, so it was filling, and you didn&#39;t feel unhealthy when you ate it. <br><br>My mom ordered the 14 oz skirt steak with chimichurri and a side. I ordered a 12 oz NY Strip Steak, great amount of char and gristle. Both steaks were cooked to PERFECTION at medium rare--we were both super shocked and pleasantly surprised. And we even had leftovers for the next day, and they were STILL soft and moist! Great cuts of beef, all fresh. <br><br>Overall, a great time, especially when you go during lunch/dinner, when there is fast turnaround so you&#39;ll get fresh food.

I particularly like this location more than their uptown one as it feels more cozy and authentic. Their starters are fantastic and downright addictive. They set you up with a big basket of bread, cheese, meat, zuchinni, garlic bread, and bruschetta. Everything is AMAZING, it might be my favorite part of the meal. Onto the food we actually purchased, I was not too impressed. They have a small menu but way too many specials. We started with the calamari which we thought we ordered the fried one but somehow got grilled in a spicy marinara sauce. It was good but not what we ordered. Next I got the cavatelli with sausage and broccolli rabe. It was delicious, a little too al dente and hard but the taste was spot on, it was garlicky and very flavorful. It tasted even better the next day after microwaving. My husband got the chicken paillard which he liked but it was nothing special. Lastly we ended with the tiramisu and Italian cheesecake. Tiramisu was not good. The ratio of lady fingers to mascarpone was way off. It had way too much cream, all butter tasting and no coffee taste whatsoever. We were very disappointed. The Italian cheesecake was delicious as always. Creamy with a slight taste of almond paste. Overall we had a good time but truthfully I found the free starters and cheesecake to be the only things worth the visit. Entrees were good but could use work, might be better to have smaller menu. Service could be better. Our server was attentive but service got very slow towards the end. When we were still working on our starters a server came to clear our table and took the cheese and garlic bread we were still working on. He took it before we could say anything, later when we told him we weren&#39;t done he sent us more cheese but no garlic bread which was a shame because it was insanely good.

I was happy and surprised to see that the RW menu hadn&#39;t changed much over the years. All the staple dishes are still on the menu.<br><br>When we arrived at 6pm was almost empty aside from a few tables and it was DEAD quiet. I was really hoping the environment would liven up a bit, and if definitely did by the end of our meal. Regardless, the ambiance was super cool and just as gorgeous and pristine as it looks in pictures.<br><br>I see people complaining about the waitresses in a lot of reviews, but ours was really sweet so I can&#39;t relate. Yes, all of the waitresses, hostesses, and bartenders are young hot things lol but we didn&#39;t come here to compete with them for a modeling contest. We came for the food, y&#39;all. And the waitresses were nice! Just because they might be dressed a bit fancier than you doesn&#39;t automatically mean they&#39;re going to be rude. Now I feel like their defense lawyer, but okay... Our VERY NICE waitress brought us our menus and consistently checked on us to see if we had any questions on the menu items or needed drink suggestions. Again, in the reviews, people found this annoying but I really think they&#39;re just being attentive. You guys are a hard crowd. Damn.<br><br>Since we wanted to try as many of the RW menu items as possible, we decided to mix and match. For apps, we tried the Spicy Beef Salad which was kinda weird and the Fried Spring Rolls, which were awesome. In regards to the salad, the portion was HUGE and definitely more than enough for 2 people to split, but the beef just tasted like cold cut roast beef which was extremely strange and off-putting although the dressing was bomb. Definitely not something I&#39;d order again (or something I&#39;d want to pay full price for).<br><br>For entrees, we tried the Grilled Salmon which was cooked perfectly, and the Spicy Chicken. The chicken was pretty good in my opinion, but I didn&#39;t realize that it was going to be a dish of fried chicken pieces. Very interesting and unexpected, and heavy on the turmeric. We also tried each of the sides, one plain Jasmine Rice and one Sticky Rice which just looked like fried rice to me. I didn&#39;t try the Sticky Rice because the staff advised that it was made with sesame, but it didn&#39;t seem like I was missing much there.<br><br>For dessert, we tried one of each of the options - one Lemon Tart and one sorbet which comes with a scoop of raspberry and a scoop of coconut. I really enjoyed both.<br><br>It was the standard $42 pp and excluded drinks.

The Tortelli Di Castagne, the oxtail and mushroom pasta daily special, and the white truffle pasta daily special were good and I thought the caramelized onion and lemon pastas were the main standouts. The Tagliatelle Con Cipolla was like a French onion soup in wonderful pasta form and the Pappardelle Al limone was delicious, lemony, creamy goodness. The Paccheri Strascicati had a hearty meat sauce, but was a little too al dente. Zero regrets trying more of the pastas than fewer, but in hindsight do wish we tried a proper main while there. <br><br>For drinks, I tried their classic Negroni and another variation the server recommended.

I didn&#39;t know what Panzerotti was until today. It&#39;s like a calzone as we know it, but fried instead of baked. And the dough is rolled out thinner. It was yummy. They offer savory and sweet panzerotti. I would give the food five stars because it was very fresh and the bread part was delicious. I got smoked salmon, fresh mozzarella, arugula and it was served on/in an empty calzone/panzerotti &#34;shell&#34;. It really really scrumptious. Unfortunately I had to send my first Panzerotti back because it had truffle oil on it. I detest truffle oil. So they really need to indicate that on the menu. Fortunately another person behind me also ordered the salmon too and overheard me me mention the truffle oil. She also did not want truffle oil. Fortunately, they made another Panzerotti for me. Sadly, I waited 15 minutes for my Panzerotti to be remade. It does not take 15 minutes to put smoked salmon, mozzarella and arugula on a calzone. I got there about 11:50 AM. So it wasn&#39;t that crowded. I&#39;ll attribute it to the staff getting ramped up. I have to say that the homemade spicy potato chips were a highlight. They had just the right amount of heat. and they weren&#39;t barbecue flavored, which I liked. I would&#39;ve liked to have eaten the with my sandwich but because I was waiting so long, I ate all my chips before I got my panzerotti. Oh well. The food was excellent and I think my instance was probably a one off. I also sampled their &#34;Classic&#34; which was already made. I preferred my panzerotti with the smoked salmon.

I&#39;ll admit this place was worth the trek in the sweltering summer heat. I get inside and order the #2 with Pepperoni and Mozzarella cheese. I figured if they can master a classic, then everything else on the menu should be just as amazing. I sit and wait a few minutes while browsing the &#34;social media&#39;s&#34; and munching on complimentary potato chips (they make these in-house, very good if you wanted to know) wondering when I&#39;ll be able to eat as the lunch hour was ticking down. (There was a wait because they are freshly made.) I was then handed a paper bag within which contained a hefty pocket of warm goodness. I contemplated walking back to the office with this treasure but ultimately decided to chow down post haste. Be warned, the contents were very hot but definitely tastes better warm. Upon initial inspection, it looked like a calzone but fried and I&#39;ve never had a calzone before. I&#39;ve only witnessed Ben Wyatt enter the &#34;Calzone Zone&#34; on NBC&#39;s Park&#39;s and Rec. \u00a0It was love at first bite. The dough was like nothing I&#39;ve tasted before, crunchy outside and soft pillowy inside. I was pleasantly surprised at how it wasn&#39;t greasy at all. I didn&#39;t have to employ any napkins and started to doubt if it was even deep fried in the first place. As I ate on, I was then greeted with delicious gooey cheese and savory pepperoni slices that perfectly complimented the crunchy dough. I was so astounded by the flavor and mouth texture that I had to speak with the owner. The owner was actually sitting next to me and we had a wonderfully warm conversation with me raving about his restaurant. He even stated that a portion of each order is donated to &#34;Mary&#39;s Meals&#34; charity to end child hunger globally and today was the restaurants 3 month anniversary. Im glad to hear my gluttony benefits somebody other than just me and I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu, 5 out of 5 stars.

The Tomahawk - we asked it to be medium-rare it was made medium, but otherwise was tasty and tender! We ordered two glasses of Barolo to accompany the meal.

I wish I&#39;d yelped this place instead of going with the glowing reviews from other sites endorsed by the restaurants themselves. 5 star reviews: it&#39;s quite obvious you did not actually eat here or have a pretty low bar for flavor. Additionally, maybe you are friends or made friends with the staff who were having a particularly good day and took to you if you&#39;d received good service because the 2-3 star yelps review all have a common thread- poor service and I am in complete agreement. <br><br>The food wasn&#39;t awful- it was passable, but for the price, it was a disappointment. We were paying purely for the location and decor, not the quality nor execution of the cuisine... because there was little to none. The 4 and a half (3 yr old) of us had the prix fixe dinner for $42pp. We opted for some upgrades sans wine: ricotta meatballs, octopus (+$10), arugula salad, strip steaks (+$10), and wild salmon. Octopus was nicely charred but cooked about 20 seconds too long on each side that made it a bit dry and tough. Ricotta meatballs were textually lacking in any firmness, herbaceousness and salt. The sauce that would&#39;ve saved the meatballs was lacking in quantity. Topped with 2 slices of stale crostini- it goes to show you can never judge a book by its pretty cover. <br><br>After extended wait time, our entrees arrived and my discerning cousin immediately noticed the odd appearance of the New York strip steaks that 3 of us upgraded to. They were not on-bone, thick, tender nor seasoned- at all! I thought they were soft albeit bland but my companion quite vehemently insisted the steaks were sinewy, lacking in every flavor/texture profile that normal $54 cuts of meat should have. We were an hour in, tired, hungry and were not going to argue. It wasn&#39;t awful (to me) but definitely not good. The &#34;wild&#34; salmon on the other hand, very surprisingly was great. It was golden, crusty, red-brown throughout whereby judging from the appearance we thought they must&#39;ve overcooked it. They didn&#39;t. It was exactly medium-delicious-tender-rare. The sides were completely negligible. In fact, what sides? You mean the home fries and a grape tomato and half of a grilled lemon on each of our plates? At least they were more memorable than the paltry, almost soggy &#34;truffle&#34; thin cut fries we ordered to share. <br><br>I don&#39;t have the time nor heart to go onto dessert shaming- lemoncello tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake and chocolate cake. Yummy sounding, no? If you haven&#39;t already noticed the trend here, Il Mulino Prime is all foam, no beer. The best dish we had was the complimentary mini charcuterie starter. That is sad. <br><br>I&#39;ve spent too much energy on the food alone- which was just mediocre at best. For a brand touted as high end luring ppl to an approx $80pp dinner for restaurant week, Il Mulino Prime really needs to hire an entire new kitchen and wait staff. I&#39;ve ragged enough about the cooks and haven&#39;t left enough time to gripe about the service!<br><br>They were abhorrent. With an exception of a charming, gracious bartender. Our slicked back, not exactly appeasing waiter asked &#34;will you be opting for restaurant week menu&#34; not to assist us but as if to gauge our spending potential. It was not subtle. None of the inattention, pretentiousness, and rubbish was. As a service professional, the importance of putting a patron&#39;s comfort and desire before your own is paramount to the individual and company success. If I had an hour I would freely drill this into the entire service team at il Mulino Prime, because they so desperately need a good example. <br><br>Btw... You cannot use &#34;aged&#34; hanger steak if it is not actually aged. It is clearly flaunted on the menu but when asked how the hanger was aged, the waiter acknowledged it isn&#39;t aged, whereby I promptly pointed to the print. He went into the kitchen and promptly return to apologize in-genuinely about the &#34;misprint&#34;... it is Not aged. <br><br>Even in the face of glaring hypocrisy and outright dishonesty, it is unlikely il Mulino would pull those menus. How many people unknowingly have ordered this misprint and went on their merry way? Every single one of them. How many times has il Mulino just shrug off this &#34;Oops&#34; Lie amongst other inaccurate descriptions? A good restaurant serves good food and pays full attention to every detail. A reputable restauranteur and a good manager stands behind their product and care about more than just turning the table.

Once the food came out we ordered a total of 5 over medium eggs with our meal. We noticed the whites were not fully cooked. It was more over easy. It took about 10 more minutes for the server to pass us and my wife called to him and explained. He literally told us it was cooked properly. We explained that it was not and this needs to be cooked again. Finally he said ok. I have to take it back to show the cooks. He said the only way is to take the plates from us. I told him we were still eating from the plate. Instead of offering another plate to put the eggs in he simply walked away. I explained the situation to a very young Latina woman whom claim to be the manager. She was clearly annoyed I brought this to her. She offered a discount. I said cool. She discounted and gave me a receipt. I noticed the bill was still a bit high. So I asked for an itemized copy. She discounted $1. I could see in her face she was a bit shocked when I asked for the itemized copy. I didn&#39;t even bother to say anything but at the end of the day they won&#39;t get another penny from me.

When we arrived there, the cashier offered us a seat, and as I proceeded to tell her that I had ordered online she then yells at her coworkers that I ordered online but decided to eat it here, instead. That, apparently was a huge problem for everyone, having to unpack the food from the containers and put it in plates to be served. Well, they do it and this is when the servers start looking at us and treating us like dogs looking for free food or something. Throwing the plates on the table and then leaving, not acknowledging anything or asking us whether we needed anything (for which I had to be ordering and asking the cashier for service and this upset her). We were very unsatisfied with all of this and proceeded to pay and leave. While I was paying (to the cashier again, mind you), I asked what was the big deal about us making the mistake of ordering online and eating it here? She said this had never happened (really?). Then I asked why was the server treating us this way. She said that because she (the server) wasn&#39;t aware that we ordered online (as if this explains her more than nasty, impolite, extremely rude behavior). Then I said that if I&#39;m seating there she should expect a tip regardless of whether we ordered online or not. Then the cashier said that it was not about the money, then I asked: then what is it about? To which I she don&#39;t reply and just processed my payment (to which I added an undeserving gratuity).

So, even after telling him that we ordered it mild, and him, explaining that it could be made mild, and that they made a mistake, he didn&#39;t replace the dish or take it off the bill!

I showed her in the menu where they have it by the glass. My boyfriend ordered a glass of rose. She comes back with two glasses of rose and I told her I ordered red which I had clearly physically pointed out to her in the menu. She said it&#39;s rose and showed me a similar name of a wine in the rose section, which obviously wasn&#39;t the one I had asked for. She went back and got me the wine I requested. The glass of rose was about 3 oz less than the pour of the red, which was also smaller than expected. We didn&#39;t bother to say anything about this. We had come here hoping for the lobster tikka masala which sounded amazing. So when it came time to order, we ordered a samosa appetizer, garlic naan, mushroom naan, paneer makhani and lobster tikka masala. After a couple min the waitress came back saying they didn&#39;t have lobster that night, which was very disappointing. I would expect to be informed of any items that are missing off a menu prior to ordering. We ordered chicken tikka masala. For the quality of food- samosa filling was undercooked, chicken in the tikka masala was dry, and the paneer tasted rotten. Both of us also felt the taste of the gravy in our entrees was a bit bland. The naans were just ok. I actually had to send back the paneer makhani because the cheese tasted so bad. The waitress offered a replacement meal, which was nice, but I was very put off by the experience and just wanted to get out of there. She ended up comping the paneer makhani and the garlic naan.

The salmon tartine had me drooling, and I cannot wait to order another one. <br><br>I will point out that the menu says the salmon tartine comes with pesto, and I feel that this is inaccurate. The vibrant green sauce on the tartine seemed to be basil oil, not true pesto. It did not appear to contain pine nuts, garlic, nor any kind of cheese like Parmesan or pecorino like one would expect in pesto. Don&#39;t let this deter you though. It&#39;s still delicious, and I think the fresh flavor of a simple basil oil was actually better than a true pesto would have been. <br><br>My sister got the Brie tartine. To be totally honest, I thought her tartine looked disappointing compared to mine. It was much smaller, and of course simpler, but the size of it alone was what really made me not want it.

If you happen to spot Ines along the way, definitely drop by for a cup of joe and one of their sandwiches. It just might be a tad pricier than other spots.<br><br>The coffee is pretty good here. The flavors are nice, and thankfully, I haven&#39;t encountered a bitter flavor. The temperature is on the warm side, which could be an annoyance to some. I don&#39;t mind it though because I&#39;m not waiting for my coffee to cool down. The chai is also good if you want an alternate, but they have other options. I am going to assume their beverages are all served on the more warm side though for a reason. I was pleasantly surprised by the sandwiches here. For breakfast, I have so far tried the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich, the Salmon Club, and the Croque Madame (their Monsieur with an egg on top). The BEC comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, and swiss on a hero. They actually modified my sandwich a bit by using American cheese and adding some arugula. I was perfectly okay with this though. This sandwich was great. I really liked the scrambled eggs on this. There was a bit of an herbal flavor, maybe rosemary, coming through. The bread was perfectly toasted and easy to bite into. The Croque Madame is slightly more heavy with black forest ham, bechamel, mustard, and swiss cheese. I was less into this sandwich, but I liked the kick of mustard in this. I highly recommend asking for the Monsieur with an egg on top (for an extra fee). The Salmon Club is very tasty and light. It comes with smoked salmon, capers, cr\u00e8me fraiche, arugula and cucumbers. <br><br>I&#39;ve really enjoyed the sandwiches here so far. My only issue is that it&#39;s a bit expensive, as expected of the upper east, so I can&#39;t say I will go too often.

My daughter had a reservation for I think six people and decided it had to cancel three or four guest from her table. Immediately the person who took her car or who she saw while she was there was very annoyed and irritated that they had to change the number of people visiting in fact she was told if they do not keep the reservation they will be charge a $400 fee. On top of that they change my daughters location and made her and her a few friends sit in the front next to the door which is very very cold I believe it was snowing during that time. I2 was at the same restaurant with a client/vendor having dinner and arrive prior to my daughter Arriving mind you we had dinner and I dropped $600 for three people. Again the food was mediocre at best. My daughter was seated with her friends and they ordered through meals and one of the meals was very very spicy and basically just the flavor was not there she asked the waiter did she could talk to the manager because she didn&#39;t want to bit her frustration over the reservation the manager sitting at the bar ignored her. He ignored the whole table. I went over there and asked him to come have a conversation with us as I discovered he was Italian and my family living in Italy may help keen over some of the frustration. He agreed to come and then turned around and sent another server to our table. The server offered to take off the one meal that they were complaining about. That just was not enough because all we wanted to do is have a conversation with him. He comes over with the most disrespectful attitude and basically said I know you just don&#39;t want to pay the bill and told the server just to take the whole bill off and walked away. There was a lady sitting at the bar who was also talking to this manager and saying that she just didn&#39;t think we wanted to pay the bill. It&#39;s pretty ironic I just spent $600 an hour before and all of a sudden we are complaining not not wanting to pay your bill but just the attitude and the service with this reservation. I will say this at first I thought maybe he was racist because it&#39;s easy to fall into the gap. But after looking at some of the reviews I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. I understand we are in New York City and I understand New Yorkers tend to be more upfront then the service that you get in California where everyone caters to you but what I don&#39;t understand is that he felt it was his duty or obligation to demean us look down on us and be downright rude crude and disrespectful.

I don&#39;t mind paying when I get great food and service, but it&#39;s not so here. For the same price, my meal yesterday night at 8282 in LES was way better. <br><br>I arrived at 10pm - quite convenient they close so late. Inside was only half full but still felt quite loud with their blasting music. Inside was too dark for my liking too. Walking out felt like a relief because the stairs had nice little lights to guide you up and down the stairs to the actual restaurant. The street lights were also brighter than inside. <br><br>I ordered a bunch of skewers over two rounds. I wanted to try out both salt and tare before deciding which one I like more. I like how they give you a stack of order sheets, so I can always refer to the menu while waiting/eating and no need to ask for additional sheets to order more. <br>Best: short rib<br>Nice: chicken thigh (I can&#39;t decide between scallion and yuzu but slightly leaning towards scallion), eggplant, king oyster mushroom<br>Mediocre: meatball, ebi (shrimp (they didn&#39;t clean out its intestine)), asparagus, zucchini<br>Meh: chicken wing (it was so little meat and so dry)<br><br>I ended up liking salt more than tare. The tare didn&#39;t add much flavor imo. Salt more obviously added more flavor and it didn&#39;t feel too salty. <br><br>Their lemon wedge is barely a wedge. It&#39;s not user friendly because it&#39;s too small. It just folds sideways rather than fold onto itself to squeeze juice out. <br>Out of the two seasonings you can sprinkle on yourself, I like the red one more than the green one. The green one doesn&#39;t add much flavor. The red one isn&#39;t spicy but adds a bit of umami and texture to meats. <br><br>I ordered two rounds because I wasn&#39;t full after the first. I wasn&#39;t exactly full after the second either but I stopped feeling empty. I was debating whether to get takoyaki or onigiri to wrap up my meal, but I stopped. Their specialty is yakitori anyway.

Stopped by solo around 6:30pm on a Saturday and sat at the back bar in front of the cash register area. Got a nice view of all the skewers cooking!<br><br>What I mean by strange is that, even though the music was loud &amp; it was busy, the staff was relaxed and chatting to each other around me - in perfect English. Just some young adults from Queens or New Jersey or something, maybe NYU Students. But the times they asked if I needed anything or I asked to order an extra skewer or for the check, whichever staff member it was spoke in an ETHNIC ACCENT (like an ESL Japanese, Chinese, or Indian person)...then returned back to standing around &amp; chatting about their boyfriend, holiday plans, with their co-worker in a perfect American English way. A few girls were possibly speaking a Thai dialect to each other, but then switched back to perfect English. I literally watched an interaction with the brunette cashier seating a couple, explaining the ordering menu in perfect English, minutes later giving me the check with a sort of thick Brazilian or Russian accent. <br><br>Maybe they thought I was a tourist, but still; not PC to imitate accents in ANY job. I don&#39;t think the business is Japanese-owned, all the staff greets customers the Japanese way. Fine, Gyu-kaku does this, but why play pretend in accented English the rest of the night. If I noticed this, I&#39;m sure plenty of other customers noticed the way their server spoke. I don&#39;t think a business should have to pretend to be a Japanese-owned \u00a0Izakaya, it&#39;s pretty clear all of the staff are all American young adults (and manager&#39;s name on their business card too). As long as the respect for the food is there.. The staff service &amp; attention was very good though- it&#39;s just the accents...<br><br>The food was really good, for about $34 I ordered (more like a light meal, Would have been more filling with a beer): <br><br>Skewers: fresh &amp; juicy, came out at intervals, about $2.50 - $4 each<br><br>- Shishito Peppers (salt)<br>- Smelt (Tare- sweet soy sauce seasoned) <br>- Pork Belly wrapped Mochi (salt) *highly recommend if you like gnocchi texture<br>- Chicken Neck (Tare)<br>- Thigh Drumstick (Tare), slightly underdone, nothing special <br><br>Couldn&#39;t decide between the Takoyaki, Rice Ball, or Toribar Slider. Chose the slider and it was a super soft lightly crispy Chicken Katsu sandwich, with a big slice of tomato, fresh cabbage &amp; mayo, pickle, Katsu sauce, on a soft brioche bun. SO Good, SO messy. SO tall that you have to take 2 bites to taste it. Came out at the end of the meal &amp; glad that I tried something different. Probably not an authentic dish, but liked how they created this one. <br><br>Lots of tables were eating Nabe, a simmering stew/soup with fresh ingredients cooked at the table. The Yakisoba (noodles) and Omelette dishes looked great too. Skewers seem to be the main dish here. The Rice Balls looked okay, wish they were grilled, but I think they&#39;re just rice and seaweed. I want to come back to try other dishes, but I don&#39;t know if I want to deal with the accents of the staff again. Pretty Immature, it must be a super awkward work culture there, join the group in playing around with the customers &amp; pick an accent to imitate! Maybe it helps buffer late-night drunk tables.

This place immediately felt authentic. \u00a0<br><br>Inase is the definition of a hidden gem. Their fish is truly top notch. Jun is the owner and sushi chef and he walked us through all his fish, most of which is flown in from Japan. We started with the 10 piece sushi and each piece was more delicious than the last. Everything was incredibly fresh. Both pieces of toro melted in your mouth, as did the uni, the well treated squid, and just about every other piece.

All of this + a salad for $60, great pricepoint for fish that was on par with omakases that charge 3X elsewhere. <br><br>While most people talk about the fish, it is often the rice that separates a good sushi restaurant from a great one. The rice here was delicious and unique. Hard to put my finger on exactly what they did with it, but it was excellent. <br><br>After our pieces, we moved onto a couple hand rolls, which did not disappoint. Delicious ingredients, crispy seaweed and overall amazing. One of them was spicy tuna, which chef Jun prepared right in front of us. None of them premade spicy tuna slop that other places serve up. He hand chopped fresh delicious high quality tuna, seasoned it with some delicious spicy seasoning and it was probably the most delicious spicy tuna I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>Beyond the incredible sushi served, it must be noted the amazing care and attention to detail chef Jun puts forth. He takes great pride in his craft and it shows. Both Jun and Shoko were so lovely and accommodating. <br><br>Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will not be disappointed.

So we figured, what the heck, let&#39;s give this Indian Food Cart a try.<br><br>We waited about 10 minutes, averaging about a minute a person to pay and serve. Finally got to the front and ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala ($6.00) from the two ladies. As I ordered, I never noticed anyone more miserable than these two ladies. I don&#39;t know if it was the heat wave that NYC has received (with 7 straight days of above 90\u00ba humid weather), or if they did not like their job, but generally people in the service industry are happy or try to put a smile on their face. The one lady took my money and bagged the food and nan wrapped in aluminum foil, as the other lady served the food into the styrofoam container. As I walked away, I hoped their mood didn&#39;t speak for their food.<br><br>I finally got back to my office and opened the container, and noticed three separate areas for the food, one with the chicken tikka masala, another with the mixed vegetables (onions, peas, and carrots(?)) in some sort of spicy curry-like sauce, and the basmati rice in the large area. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was tender and tasty (only slightly spicy) but I found the sauce was a little runny (my coworker got the chicken curry which was also a little thin in consistency but had a nice kick/spice to it). The mixed vegetables in the curry sauce was thicker in consistency and pretty delicious. I wish they would have used that sauce for their chicken dishes as it left me wanting more. The basmati rice was nothing to rave about, as it was normal rice with slight seasonings, noticeable only by those with a sensitive palate. But with all the spices going around, the rice could have used a bit more flavor. The nan was a big disappointment as it was just warm pita bread.<br><br>In all, I thought an Indian Food Cart is pretty original, as you don&#39;t see many others like it.

Perfect for people, or puppy watching!<br><br>The bread service was nothing to write home about. We were each given two slices of bread, which were fairly large but lacked any real texture.

It&#39;s like the calamari was pulled out of the fryer a minute or so too soon and someone forgot to sprinkle the salt on top. The marinara sauce it came with was fine, but it didn&#39;t add anything to overall flavor of the fried calamari. <br><br>Lasagna alla Bolognese [$23]: Is $23 a little expensive for lasagna? Yes, it is. Was the lasagna the best I&#39;ve ever had? Yes, it was. The first bite was a perfect piece of bolognese ragu. I can&#39;t tell you why it was perfect, it just was. The lasagna itself was smothered with cheese, the edges of the pasta were crispy and delicious. I&#39;m still dreaming about the lasagna. <br><br>Tartufo [$11]: Ugh. They tried to fancy up the tartufo by coating it with cocoa powder. Any old school Italian place in Brooklyn coats the tartufo (usually filled with vanilla ice cream) with a hard chocolate shell. This is the only way it should be done.<br><br>I had a glass of the Riesling [$12] which was fine, I like Riesling. <br><br>My boyfriend had the Linguine con Cozze e Vongole [$27] which had clams and mussels in it.

This might be a tad unfair to say since this small coffee kiosk is located in the lobby of a prestigious building. The architecture of the Nomad tower is reminiscent of Bauhaus styled architecture, with interesting column cement forms , naked textures, and railings that surround the stairs leading to the forbidden lower level. <br><br>While this architecture is interesting it is cold stark and lacking comfort. The simplicity in design leaves one not feeling welcomed, but forewarned not to touch anything that looks expensive. For this reason the ambience gets 1 point. <br><br>The food is limited, as a kiosk location would be, but the selection is vast enough to satiate the hurried passerby or executives that emanate from the floors above. When it comes to coffee places I prefer a larger selection of drip coffee and espresso beans that would really get the caffeine aficionado&#39;s heart pumping. Alas they only had a mild roast coffee and limited amenities to offer. The breads, snacks, and assorted desserts where cold but well preserved. For this I offer 1 point. <br><br>The service was fast, while a kiosk usually boasts a total of only one employee this kiosk had two to handle the burst of busy patrons looking to get moving with their coffee bean elixirs for their morning motivational meetings. <br><br>Walk into Irving Farms New York at Nomad Tower for a quick coffee or stay for some work at their long shared table.

Pasta was authentic and cooked al dente. Our friend had dietary needs that were met with ease and was extremely Happy with his meal. The young gentleman Benny was a pleasure.

I was looking for a new spot for West Indian food and was glad this place sounded like they made things homemade, but to be honest, although a chain, Golden Krust is better. I can&#39;t attest to any other main protein dishes, because honestly if you don&#39;t do the oxtail right, i don&#39;t care about the chicken, whether it&#39;s jerk or stew. My advice, don&#39;t offer things on your menu that you don&#39;t make well.<br>The mac and cheese seems to have a velveeta type of base, because I did not taste any real grated cheese. <br>I think that the patties are also made in house? The beef has a flaky pastry crust, but the chicken didn&#39;t. The beef was better. <br>3 stars is because i didn&#39;t find anything foreign in my food and it came well packaged.

I swapped the soft boiled eggs for marinated eggs for about $0.50 extra. As for the ordering process, you place the order on a kiosk in the back of the restaurant. Since this was my first time at the restaurant, I was confused at the ordering process and the types of noodles and combinations. There was one person in the front of house, but when they go to the back to retrieve the noodles, there is no one to explain the ordering process. There is only one kiosk and the line builds quickly while people are confusingly trying to place orders. After ordering, they bring your bowl, which is mostly dry ingredients.

Rockefeller who called them home for nearly forty years. The feel here is understated elegance. I think this is the perfect date restaurant. It is very romantic with tables set up individually on the steps of the various townhouses lit by candlelight. It was not stuffy or over done. We had martinis to start. They were good but served in Champagne glasses rather than martini glasses. I don&#39;t care but our friend pointed it out. We moved on to appetizers of veal meatballs and octopus. The meatballs were very well prepared, moist, tasty, not too large and disappeared quickly, enjoyed by all. I ordered the special risotto with vegetables and made with a rich pork broth. It was perhaps the best risotto I ever had, creamy and vibrant, and was a healthy portion. My sister had lobster ravioli which she enjoyed. She said it was creamy and she could actually taste the lobster pieces in the ravioli. It was also a healthy portion. Even though we were mostly stuffed, we ordered deserts- a limoncello sponge cake and a dark chocolate sponge cake with raspberry, which were satisfying and special and just the right size The waiter brought little almond cookies to end as an added little nosh as well. <br>The service was friendly and attentive.

I realize that perhaps the old saw that is &#34;If you need to ask, you can&#39;t afford it&#34; may apply. I can afford it, but I also am wary of paying much more than I should. For example, their online menu lists a full order of Linguine all&#39;Amatriciana as $24.50. My waiter convinced me to have half an order of all&#39;Amatriciana and half an order of a special ravioli. On the bill the 1/2 Amatriciana was $18.95 and the 1/2 special $21.95, so high, but not outrageous. The problem is that it might have been $50 or $75 because there was no menu nor prices. I heard a waiter pitch adding white truffle shaved on the pasta of a table for 3. I didn&#39;t hear the waiter mention a price, but I know that other restaurants in the area charge a supplement of around $100/plate for white truffles. I wonder if the clients at that table knew what they were getting into?<br><br>I would likely have ordered more food and wine than I did, if they&#39;d provided a menu so I could see the details of what I was ordering.<br><br>The food was mixed. The Amatriciana was pretty good, the special ravioli wasn&#39;t very good. The Tiramisu was okay (and again, the list was verbally recited, not provided as a menu with description and price).", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": 387, "reviewCount": 126, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "11/6/2022", "comment": {"text": "WOW!

The sausage pasta was absolutely delicious and I would come back just to eat this again. It seemed like a staff favorite as well.

You see, dear reader, it all began on a day when my soul was in need of nourishment, and my taste buds were craving an adventure.<br><br>After a spiritually enlightening visit to the Church of the Holy Trinity, I found myself on a quest for sustenance, and fate led me to this delightful establishment. As I walked in, the aroma of deliciousness wafted through the air, promising a gastronomic journey like no other.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s talk about the stars of the show - the wings! These aren&#39;t just any wings; they are the epitome of flavor, the apex of taste bud ecstasy. The garlic parmesan wings were a revelation, a perfect marriage of garlic&#39;s pungent allure and parmesan&#39;s creamy embrace. And the fried chicken sandwiches? Oh, they were like a crispy, juicy hug for my senses. But wait, there&#39;s more - the cheese fries were a symphony of gooey, cheesy goodness that deserves a standing ovation.<br><br>But it wasn&#39;t just the savory delights that stole the spotlight; the sweet treats were equally enchanting. The brownies were fudgy squares of chocolate nirvana. Asida, a dessert I had never tried before, turned out to be a delightful surprise with its unique flavor and texture. And the crumble, oh my, it crumbled my resistance to dessert.<br><br>One of the things that truly impressed me was the option for takeaway. In a world where time is of the essence, being able to savor these delectable dishes on the go is a godsend. The friendly staff, always ready with a smile, made the experience even more delightful. They say that service with a smile enhances the flavor of a meal, and here, they&#39;ve perfected the art.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s address the elephant in the room - prices. Affordable is an understatement. You get gourmet-level dishes without needing to auction off your prized possessions. It&#39;s like a culinary steal, a secret treasure trove of taste that won&#39;t break the bank.<br><br>The decor and atmosphere? Impeccable. The fine decor and lovely ambiance make you feel like you&#39;re dining in the lap of luxury, even though you&#39;re indulging in comfort food. It&#39;s the perfect place to relax, enjoy a meal, and let the flavors transport you to a state of bliss.<br><br>In conclusion, the International Wings Factory isn&#39;t just a restaurant; it&#39;s a flavor sanctuary.

The culinary training and background of Deepak shine through in the product. I ordered them extra crispy, which would be the sweet spot for how you would likely want your wings. I also ordered them naked with the sauces on the side, which is how I would order them to go , because they were crispy when I got home and...listen to this...They were crispy the next day simply warming them in the oven, not microwave, without a convection oven or air fryer assist. They are not audibly as crisp as Korean wings, but all other comparisons for the wing connoisseur, these wings are crispy and you can order them one step crispier if you like yours fried hard.<br><br>I go into all this, because a true wing connoisseur gets into these details. The wings here have flavor to the bone, the only way I would order them, but to each his or her own. Deepak &#39;s preparation of the wings involves some type of brining or marinating. There is also some care in sourcing the wings too if I am not mistaken. So a lot of details are given attention here, as well as their own sauces they prepare at International Wings Factory. Nothing is coming out of packets or poured out of jugs, save for the ketchup. The details matter here.<br><br>I can confidently state the wings here will please nearly anyone&#39;s palate with sauces that range from mild to very hot. I had the Vietnamese chili mango and the Confession buffalo type sauce. Neither of these was particularly challenging in my opinion and those who like it spicy will likely want to step it up to the third and fourth levels of heat here for the sauces. The Vietnamese chili mango was actually less spicy than the Confession. The Confession was very tangy, but neither was salty. I like places where \u00a0they produce flavor without all the sodium or overly salty taste.<br><br>Their fries are not an afterthought. I had the regular fries and sweet potato fries. Both were excellent and those who are connoisseurs of fries will be quite pleased with the results. There are better fries out there, but no one will be looking for them here. One recommendation would be to develop an in-house sauce of cinnamon, maple syrup and mustard or smoked paprika for the sweet potato fries. All of a sudden, the sweet potato fries would be a hit unto themselves...<br><br>The one downside to all the attention paid to the details would be the price is a bit steep for what one receives. 25 wings will run you $45, plus whatever else you order. I&#39;m certain inflation has influenced the pricing here, but it is something to consider when one has tons of options in NYC. If you&#39;re looking for something on the side or to watch the game, these are your wings. If you are looking for sustenance and substance, you have other options. There are a handful of small tables where you can sit and enjoy them fresh and the small place is comfortable. \u00a0Deepak and the folks here are personable and welcoming.

Lol. Some big place with maybe steel on the walls, exposed ventilation, TVs everywhere and a girl with a cowboy hat riding a mechanical bull in the back. Not the case, but I was not disappointed either. So it&#39;s May 18th, 2019. My fianc\u00e9e has her hair AND makeup done because we just took our engagement pictures in Central Park! We&#39;re on a high from that so now we just need some food. What better way to celebrate than to smash on some wings while wearing bright colored clothing and white pants?<br><br>Atmosphere/Appearance: So we held our pee in until we got here thinking there would be a bathroom. Nope. The place is too small to have a public bathroom so what we actually did was went around the corner to another restaurant that was super busy then pretended to &#34;wait&#34; for a seat while using the bathroom. We rolled out after our bladders were empty then returned here. Lol. So there&#39;s maybe room for 16-20 people to eat inside, MAX. It&#39;s a hole-in-the-wall, but like a decorative hole. It looks nice inside. There&#39;s painted brick, plenty of cute decorations, quirky quotes and light colored wood. The ordering counter is straight ahead and they just bring the stuff to your seat, if you can manage to snag a seat.<br><br>Service: There isn&#39;t much table service here aside from when they bring your food or if you catch one of the staff members cleaning up. But I mean, what could you want besides more food? The refrigerator is right there if you need to grab something and pay for it. The water container is right behind that and there&#39;s always someone at the counter. We were going to get our food to go then hop in an Uber to the hotel, but the nice owner (or so I think he was) convinced us to stay. He made room for the 2 of us and my backpack to eat and we genuinely appreciated that hospitality. Shout out to you if you&#39;re reading this.<br><br>Food: THEY AAAIIIGGGHHHTTTT. They&#39;re fried and about the size of an &#34;average&#34; wing. We tried 4 sauces and first up was &#34;Mexy Q&#34;. It&#39;s a 2 out of 5 on their heat scale. It was cool. It was hard to describe, but it was what the name suggests, Mexican barbecue. Quite tasty. Next up was the &#34;Original Confession&#34;. It&#39;s their traditional buffalo sauce and I wanted to try it seeing as it was 3 out of 5 on their heat scale. It was quite flavorful and not too spicy. Next up was the &#34;Soul Purifier&#34;. Sounds spicy right? Even their description reads, &#34;Buffalo based with house blend spices and chilies. Very spicy, but not crazy hot.&#34; I like a challenge so the 5 out of 5 heat scale is what drew me to these. They tasted like their traditional buffalo sauce just cranked up a notch. I could definitely handle the heat, but I was kinda looking for something I couldn&#39;t. Know what I mean? I wanted to push the envelope. Last, but not least, was Vietnamese Chile Mango. These were my favorite of the 4 sauces. They were a 3 out of 5 on the heat scale and had a fruity, sweet taste that blended well with a bit of spice.<br><br>Value: We ordered 2 sets of 18 wings so that we could split the sauces in half for each order (yielding 4 different sauces). An order of 18 is $19.50 and that comes with 2 choices of dipping sauce (bleu cheese, ranch, chipotle mayo, creamy cilantro, jalape\u00f1o ranch and bleu cheese crumbles which they just recommend adding to their bleu cheese sauce). We also added a box of baby carrots and celery (gotta be healthy somehow) for $2.00. It&#39;s a pretty good deal in my opinion for New York City. So we smashed and had major leftovers after spending about $44.00. Not bad AT ALL.<br><br>In conclusion this whole day was just... US.

There was plenty of garlic, spices, along with butter on top, making for strong garlic taste (which is sometimes hard to find). All the different components of the platter was served in round silver bowls, on a circular silver plate, which was reminiscent of how some entrees are plated in India. <br><br>My favorite dishes were the Fish Masala and Shrimp Saag. The Fish Masala was delightfully tender, flaky, and full of yummy seasoning with bold flavors of onion, tomatoes, chilies, and fresh herbs. The Shrimp was juicy and succulent. There was also a veggie dish with lentils, onion, and more, which had great depth of flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly, and was yummy with the different sauces. I couldn&#39;t really taste the Crab though.<br><br>Service was solid. Our waiter was kind and attentive. Prices are decent, especially for the area.

This all makes it a &#34;sleeper&#34; in the Theater District/West Midtown area where so many other places are tourist traps or nosebleed-expensive corporate dining rooms. <br><br>The veggie dishes are highlights. They are prepared with care. We had the steamed carrots with tahini and the roasted cauliflower -- both delicious. We also had the whole grilled branzino, cooked perfectly (presented as a whole fish, then taken away to be fileted, French-style) and the lemon &amp; oregano fries, crispy and yummy. Good selection of regional wines by the glass.<br><br>Now let&#39;s talk about the service. The near-obsequiousness of the wait staff masks glitches and problems that they need to fix. Most seriously, the food took forever to come out, and when we asked about it, we were told that the kitchen was &#34;a little backed up.&#34; This was at 6:30 pm, with the restaurant maybe half full. Requests for salt went unheeded. Various other little things like that. Finally we asked them to just bring everything to the table as it got to the pass, and we were able to eat and get out of there on time. <br><br>We&#39;ll be back when we&#39;re looking for a nice place in that area.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 9, "reviewCount": 87, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "3/28/2023", "comment": {"text": "Came here with my girlfriend; pretty venue, egregious prices. $34 salad with overripe tomatoes.
