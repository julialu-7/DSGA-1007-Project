This is my third visit to Vino e Grano and my least favorite experience. We were seated in the main dining area and it was a semi-busy night. I have previously tried their pizza and pasta and been satisfied with both food, wine and customer service. This time however we wanted to try out the main courses so we ordered the short ribs and the hangar steak. I found it outrageous that these meals cost ~$35 and were the most bland dishes I&#39;ve had. The hangar steak came with some cooked farro, corn and squash that had NO flavor what so ever and looked liked something that could be served in a school cafeteria. Not even the added truffle had any flavor (!) I ordered my steak medium but received medium rare and again it was missing any type of seasoning. The short ribs tasted very average and wasn&#39;t served hot. We were served the wrong dish twice so overall it seemed like the staff was unorganized although it wasn&#39;t that busy. The waiter did not check in to see if everything was ok, if we needed anything else nor did he refill our water at any point. Even when collecting our plates we were not asked how it was. To me, this is the minimum you&#39;d expect from the service staff at restaurant like this. <br><br>I&#39;m deeply disappointed with this visit so my recommendation would be to stick with the pizza and pastas if you do decide to go and hope that the level of service will be better.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": 15, "reviewCount": 23, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "2/21/2019", "comment": {"text": "I&#39;m disappointed to see a three star review( linguini vongole is suppose to be in the shell lady) This restaurant is located in Eataly.

We ordered the gran misto platter which had five meats and five cheeses to share as a group and loved the variety of the platter and also the presentation. We then each ordered an entree ranging from the hanger steak to variety of pastas. Amongst our group, the standout entrees were the papperdelle (amazing housemade egg pasta with a sausage cream sauce) and the octopus pasta (so tender and expertly seasoned). I ordered the brasato (short rib) that came with polenta and must say it was my least favorite dish among all of our orders. I found the portion size confusing with very little plenty and a gigantic piece of short rib that was a bit dry for my liking.

In typical weekday morning fashion I was looking for a place that had both craft coffee and something to nibble on like avocado toast. My first attempt at finding this place on a map was unsuccessful because I hadn&#39;t realized it is actually underground in the Fulton Street station! There are a few pathways to finding it, mainly by accessing the John Street subway entrance, or by going through the revolving doors of the building on William Street, then heading downstairs. A kind security guard helped us navigate when we entered the building and before we knew it we found ourselves in the subway station! Very unexpected and almost secretive, like the coffee version of a speakeasy--they truly did take us on a voyage :&#39;)<br><br>Their menu is pretty compact but I like how they offer a range of menu items like classic espresso and pourover drinks, fresh-made food, pastries, and of course signature espresso drinks (my personal fav). <br><br>The space inside is quite cramped with one table and a few bar stools; it could seat maybe 8 people total but I think that&#39;s apt considering I&#39;m sure most of their clientele are busy commuters. That said, on a Friday mid-morning it wasn&#39;t too busy. <br><br>The employees taking and making our orders were so friendly and struck up conversation with us. Our barista kindly explained to me their signature drinks: Their lavender latte uses a housemade lavender syrup; the Space Oatly is a hazelnut and oat milk coffee; and the cafe miel is a light roast latte with honey. These types of unique concoctions are right up my alley!<br><br>I opted for the lavender latte which was excellent. It had an incredible layer of crema and the lavender flavor was so good (I&#39;ve been scarred in the past by coffeeshops that pump half a cup of Torani syrup in one drink). It was maybe a tad too sweet but I certainly need some sweetness so I would request it half sweet next time. My boyfriend who had a regular latte also enjoyed!<br><br>Our group also got all three toasts to share: the Classic Avocado with a drizzle of olive oil; the Mango Avocado with what I believe is szechaun-style chili oil (I felt the numbing!!); and the Burrata Grape. All three were fantastic. My favorite was the Burrata Grape, which was equally creamy, garlicky, savory, with a tad of sweetness from the marinated grapes--scrumptious! I can&#39;t wait to go back and have this again.<br><br>I was also pleasantly surprised by the relative affordability. The coffees were only around $5-6 and the toasts $7-8 each. The portions of the toasts are quite huge as well. Effectively one whole toast had me really full, so I think sharing one would be sufficient for a light breakfast. <br><br>Do not sleep on Voyager Coffee just because it&#39;s a bit tucked away--it is worth the trek!

Have you ever seen three waiters and the manager all standing around on their phones in the middle of lunch service before? Well, that&#39;s what goes on here. <br><br>I won&#39;t rage too much against the ridiculous prices because it&#39;s to be expected in Tribeca. But these humongous shrimp lettuce wraps came out and I was seriously puzzled on how to attack them. They are enormous, but structurally flawed. Only one flimsy lettuce leaf encased an egg-roll sized portion of noodle, carrot and shrimp filling inside. This leaf is wrapped around the mass of filling fruit-roll-up-style; meaning the ends are left open for everything to fall out. And only another flimsy piece of cucumber is wrapped around the middle to keep it all together, secured by a toothpick. Don&#39;t take out this toothpick or your food will fall apart in a mess. It&#39;s too big to dip into the accompanying sauce so that needs to be scooped out with your chopsticks and sort of smeared onto this faulty lettuce-roll-up. When I say &#34;shrimp&#34; I do mean singular shrimp. This HUGE roll consisted of exactly ONE shrimp sliced into paper thin portions to stick out on both ends. The middle was only noodle and veggies.<br><br>When it was past the 35 minute mark and my pho still hadn&#39;t arrived, I looked up to see my waiter suddenly realize I was the ONLY ONE left in the restaurant (because the rest of the lunch crowd had finished and left) and he signaled for them to START MAKING THE SOUP. He came around to clear the table next to me, and that&#39;s the only time I had a chance to tell to bring my check. I was done. <br><br>I&#39;ve had bad service in my restaurant history, but the clear disinterest by the entire waitstaff and management here is staggeringly off-putting. To be fair, I paid for my drink, shrimp roll, and even that wayward soup that they insisted on bringing out in a To Go bag with my check.

More on that later.<br><br>On the website, a brunch menu is advertised, which is why we chose to come here. We were expecting some form of brunch. We had an 11am reservation, which is early but we had commitments in the afternoon and figured we could deal with a completely empty restaurant. We needed to sit in their outdoor cabin because we brought our dog.<br><br>We arrive and the outdoor cabin is nice, but we&#39;re handed a lunch menu and a wine list, and when we asked about the brunch menu, the server named a few breakfast dishes off the top of his head that he said we could order if we wanted. The rest of the menu was pasta, salads, and heavy entrees that didn&#39;t exactly fit in the brunch vibe. <br><br>Probably the greatest part of this experience was the fact that this restaurant decided to carry out a construction project on the outdoor cabin at 11am on a Sunday. And the construction was happening quite literally inches away from our table. The drilling and hammering while they installed doors on the cabin made it difficult to hear any of our own conversations, and while I appreciate the servers apologizing for the noise, what manager/owner in their right mind would allow this to happen while customers are dining??? Debris could have hit us, gotten in our food, or disturbed our dog (luckily she&#39;s very well behaved and wasn&#39;t too phased by it, but many dogs would not have been so calm). It wasn&#39;t even like it was cold or bad weather where the doors needed to be put on that moment to make the cabin more comfortable. It was completely unnecessary to be happening during business hours. On a Sunday at brunch time when the weather is gorgeous you have to at least anticipate that customers will want to sit outside!<br><br>Even with all of the absurd construction aside, it was some of the worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced. Two of us arrived after the rest of our party and weren&#39;t given water or attended to for a solid 15 minutes after sitting. We ordered coffees because wine didn&#39;t really seem like a vibe and we would&#39;ve preferred some brunch cocktails, but we were all fine with coffee. The server never once checked on us or asked if we wanted refills or anything, and instead of clearing our empty cups when our food arrived to provide more space, he left them stacked on the edge of our table.<br><br>I ordered gnocchi alla sorrentina which was fine, nothing crazy good or crazy bad, but my boyfriend decided to risk it all and order the off-menu blueberry pancakes. Arguably some of the worst pancakes we&#39;ve ever tasted. They were bland, overcooked, and overall just super disappointing. We kind of expected it but it was still a let down. Don&#39;t advertise a brunch menu if you don&#39;t serve it and don&#39;t know how to!!!!! <br><br>Again our server never came over to check on us and I have worked at restaurants so I understand being busy, but he probably had 3 tables including us and just never came over to check on us. Which is even more disappointing considering there was drilling happening right over my shoulder throughout the entire meal. <br><br>I guess I blame the management here because to allow this all to happen is not right and quite frankly just absurd. I appreciate that the servers tried to insist on seating us inside, but since we had a dog with us we couldn&#39;t. And there were other tables who wanted to sit outside because of the nice weather. They could have at least sat us farther away from the construction if they knew it was going to happen! <br><br>Save yourself the money and go literally anywhere else. There are plenty of overpriced Italian restaurants in the upper east side that at least have good food and better service. This owner/manager has absolutely no place in the restaurant business and I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s even still open.

I&#39;ve vowed never to return and to spread the word. What happened? We had a 7 pm reservation and specifically asked for a table under the tent outside where the tables are farther apart, and were told this request would be honored. We arrived and were shown to a table right by the front door where the wait staff and customers pass very closely. We told the hostess that we had requested a table under the tent and pointed to an empty table for 2 there. She insisted that that was not possible. As we were discussing this with her, another older distinguished-looking Caucasian couple came in saying they had a 7:15 pm reservation. A different hostess came and seated that couple at the very table we were asking to be seated at, which was the last table under the tent. <br><br>We immediately asked why the other couple were being seated at the table we wanted when we had an earlier reservation and had requested that location. The hostess said well the other couple requested that table -- whereupon we said we ALSO had requested it and had the earlier reservation (7:00 vs 7:15 pm). <br><br>I don&#39;t know why this happened but could it be that we were two younger Asian customers and the other couple was an older Caucasian couple? It certainly felt that way. There were other small clues. The maitre de ignored us for several minutes when we first arrived, choosing to help other customers.

The Prosecco complemented the lively ambiance and set the tone for an enjoyable evening.<br><br>Moving on to the Chicken Caesar Salad, it was a mouthwatering delight. The salad featured fresh, crisp romaine lettuce generously coated in a creamy Caesar dressing that had just the right balance of tanginess and richness. The tender grilled chicken breast added a satisfying protein component, while the homemade croutons provided a delightful crunch. The dish was garnished with shaved Parmesan cheese, further enhancing the flavor profile. It was a well-executed rendition of a classic salad that left me fully satisfied.<br><br>The service at Versa Lounge was attentive and friendly, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. The staff members were knowledgeable about the menu, offering recommendations and accommodating any dietary preferences or allergies. Their attentiveness added an extra touch of hospitality to the overall visit.<br><br>As for the pricing, Versa Lounge aligns with its upscale rooftop atmosphere.

The resulting dishes felt like some thing you could find at any generic, non-Italian restaurant. There was never a dish that stood out as flavorful or felt like it would provide a reason for someone to specifically seek out Vincent&#39;s for a meal.

Situated under the glowing &#34;Little Italy&#34; sign, it&#39;s clear from the street that Vincent&#39;s is a longtime NY establishment. Boasting over 100 years in business, with free samples of their 3 signature sauces on the table at the entrance, Vincent&#39;s is the kitsch, dated Little Italy stereotype: a spinning dessert display of cannoli and cheesecake, walls lined with NY memorabilia and signed head shots, and a festive waitstaff in their matching uniforms. It&#39;s got a bit of a diner-y, hole-in-the-wall feel, casual feel. Definitely don&#39;t feel obligated to sport your Sunday Best. <br><br>So, don&#39;t get me wrong - their signature sauces are delicious. They have a sweet, medium, and spicy. I&#39;m a big fan of spice, but not really when it comes to Italian dishes. Unless it&#39;s a sausage or something, I&#39;d rather my taste buds focus on the herbs, cheese, and carbs. However, the medium sauce had the perfect amount of kick. <br><br>Prices are about what you&#39;d expect for a NY restaurant, if not a little more expensive. I&#39;d say just slightly pricier than an Olive Garden. Unfortunately, I could also compare the taste of the food to an Olive Garden. They do provide fresh, hot bread for the table. It&#39;s super yummy - and might have been the highlight. Be sure to ask for oil and vinegar. They have both a traditional balsamic and a spicy vinegar. I was a fan of both.<br><br>For my entr\u00e9e, I splurged on the $25 Shrimp Scampi. The portion was practically perfect, if not a little less than I was hoping for. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was a little runny and also....it was orange. Not sure where that hue came from, but it reminded me of the grease you blot off a slice of pizza. The flavor was good, but not WOW. Especially for $25. My friends ordered the lobster ravioli and substituted the Vodka sauce for their house sweet red sauce. They described their meal as &#34;subpar.&#34;<br><br>The service wasn&#39;t super fantastic.

My friend and I sat down and decided on an appetizer of fried calamari and entrees of penne a la vodka and linguine with sausage and meatballs.

My friends penne a la vodka was full of flavor and you could taste the mix of red pepper and other spices. My food on the other hand had no flavor whatsoever.

Full of garlic, pepper, and butter--so good. I added that to my linguine and it made all of the flavors pop. It is sad that I had to add the broccoli to make the linguine taste better. I am hoping that the garlic and spices really soaked in as the linguine, sauce, and meat were very sad and low on flavor. <br><br>As far as the service the waiters seemed very bored and not excited to help us at all.

While the interior is nice(r) than most Chinese restaurants in the area and the space is huge, it felt kind of like a 90s nightclub and didn&#39;t seem much like a Chinese banquet hall. The service was pretty lackluster and there was only 1 guy serving, who was unsure of our order, had to come back to check what it was, repeated it back to us correctly but still brought out the wrong item to start and I was too annoyed to ask for a correction. In any case, we got to try the mushroom yi-mein noodles which were good, and the crab soup dumplings and regular soup dumplings which were both reasonably decent. Overall, I wouldn&#39;t be back and would trade in a less fancy place for better prices and better food.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": 1433, "reviewCount": 699, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "5/26/2023", "comment": {"text": "Take a look at the menu before you settle in and order.

No pressure. Nice kid.

So we followed the guy into a dark, dingy hallway and down some stairs, a little nervous until we get to this really cute little room with red booths, and a big mural of a dragon on the ceiling. He left us in the hands of a young waiter who had one funny line after another. Very entertaining fellow. Started off with some shrimp spring rolls and shrimp toast, followed by soup dumplings, seafood fried rice, General Tso&#39;s chicken, and some chicken and broccoli.

Their filling to wrap ratio is great and even with their price increase, you get a big bang for your buck. If I&#39;m in the area with the fam, we&#39;ll order a couple of different types and just chow in the car. My tiny tot absolutely loves dumplings, probably more than me, which I could not believe was humanly possible. One thing about this place, however, is that they&#39;re always packed to the seams and it gets kind of crazy with people hovering near the plexiglass, despite having JUST ordered while there are five people that ordered before them. As hectic as it looks, however, the staff is quite organized with their service. I ordered one time in person but I&#39;ll never order on site again. I&#39;ll always order through the Yelp app for convenience and have never had an issue with my order.<br><br>GRUB RUNDOWN:<br>Dumplings - We love all things dumpling here. They&#39;ve never been a miss. My faves include the basil &amp; chicken dumpling, shrimp dumpling, shrimp &amp; chicken wonton, and spicy beef dumpling. Other than that, the guys might also get the pork &amp; chive dumplings as well. We usually order a lot because some of us like the spicy sauce and some do not, including my tiny tot (we&#39;re building up her tolerance, tho). In any case, you can always order the spicy sauce on the side. I would also insist on asking for more dipping sauce. Even when we&#39;ve ordered enough for a small army, they&#39;ve given us too few dipping sauces so make sure to get extra.<br><br>Dan Dan Mein - I have only ever ordered the dan dan noodz with spicy beef sauce and they are really good. The noodles are served with julienned carrots and cukes on top, along with the sauce of your choosing. They&#39;re definitely shareable. I love getting a bunch of different things so that we can eat family-style and try a little bit of everything. <br><br>Soups - I&#39;ve ordered wonton soups before and since it&#39;s a drive to get home, I&#39;ll ask for the wontons to be packed separate from the broth so that they don&#39;t get too soggy and break apart. Once home, adding a little broth to them will loosen them from each other, as they tend to stick together. The dumplings are always good but In my opinion, the broth leaves something to be desired; it is a bit bland. I usually order this for my little and she likes it, so it&#39;s no biggie for me. I have also ordered the white meat chicken noodle soup for her before and that had way more flavor but prefers the wonton soup, so she wins. <br><br>Sesame Pancake - My guys like these sandos. My son always gets the Peking duck with extra meat and hubby will get the beef or chicken versions. I&#39;ve had the duck sando before but it&#39;s a little bit too greasy for me and I find there&#39;s not enough meat filling and I can&#39;t resolve the need to order extra meat just to make it better, so I&#39;ve never ordered it again for myself.<br><br>To reiterate, I prefer ordering from the Yelp app. It&#39;s easy and efficient, and even if you have tons of requests, they follow everything. They will mark all the dumpling packs for you if you request, and separate your dumplings from the broth if you order soups. I&#39;ve ordered from the UWS location as well and both are the same, save for a bit of a price difference which is weird; some items cost more at either location, I&#39;m assuming based upon the demand in that area.

The waitress told us we could either continue waiting for the first floor or we could be seated right away in the basement. We decided on the latter. The basement was a bit humid and desolate but at least it was quieter than the upstairs. It was also not as set up as the upstairs which had mood lighting and candles vs the downstairs which looked like some tables and candles were thrown haphazardly around. <br><br>Our waitress came over right away with the menus and told us their policy of having to order all of our food at once but never explaining why. We decided on a bottle of white, bruschette trio, soup of the day, rigatoni alla carbonara, gnocchi of the day and homemade tiramisu. <br><br>BRUSCHETTE TRIO: We chose the pugliese (goat cheese and roasted peppers), emiliana (prosciutto and parmigiana) and ligure (shrimp). There was one of each that was served to us. The bread that the bruschetta was served on was not too memorable, kind of dry and not crispy enough; however, the toppings were the saving grace of the dish. The goat cheese one was probably my favorite - the peppers and goat cheese really meshed well together. The prosciutto was pretty good as well. And as for the shrimp, the shrimp was well done and cooked however there was way too much mustard slathered on the bread and just overpowered the taste. <br><br>SOUP OF THE DAY: The soup that we were served was a mushroom and truffle oil soup. It was a disappointment. It tasted like they threw some mushrooms into a vitamix and then dumped some truffle oil and served it. There was absolutely no flavor apart from the mushroom and oil itself. <br><br>RIGATONI ALLA CARBONARA: Pretty good carbonara over al dente pasta. Not much to complain about there. <br><br>GNOCCHI OF THE DAY: The gnocchi we were served with had some tomatoes and shrimp. The flavor of the sauce was delicious, I&#39;m just personally not a big fan of gnocchi and this one did not stand out too much for me - a bit too doughy. <br><br>HOMEMADE TIRAMISU: So delicious however was a bit too heavy on the coffee for my taste.

Prior to purchasing the pulsd deal, the fine print clearly reads that only two vouchers can be used per table and a reservation is required. <br>However, apparently after purchasing the pulsd deal the fine print changes. Which in my head is super shady....why is the fine print different prior to purchase compared to purchase.....that&#39;s false advertising. After purchasing the fine print says that you have to call for a reservation and tell them it a pulsd deal. We did not do that, which to be fair was my fault I didn&#39;t read the fine print twice (we use pulsd deals all the time and have NEVER had a requirement like this before) and the waiter was incredibly rude to us. We were ignored for the next 20-30 minutes, even though we had clearly voiced that we didn&#39;t need to use the pulsd deal we would be more than happy to just order and enjoy brunch. Finally someone took our order 45 minutes after sitting down. The waiters changed and the female waiter that we had was really great!!! I wish I could remember her name to give her a shout out.

There was 10% red sangria followed by 70% of an orange juice mix topped off with 20% club soda. The color of the drink was so light it looked barely rose tinged. I basically paid $15+ with tax and tip for a glass of orange soda. \u00a0I left the drink almost full on the bar as it was too sweet to drink. Two different bartenders asked me how my drink was and i said too sweet. I said to one of the bartenders look at the differece between the red pitcher of sangria and my drink.

I really wish I could leave more stars but had to knock stars for the lack of vegan-friendliness. <br><br>There&#39;s plenty of seating inside and outside. It&#39;s definitely a cute atmosphere and I highly recommend asking for the round table if catching up with friends! The vibe is cute but casual so you can dress up nice or wear jeans. <br><br>As a vegan, I usually look for restaurants that clearly label vegan options so removing 1 star for the forced labor. Labeling saves time for everyone - vegans, friends dining with vegans, and restaurant staff fielding these requests. Not to mention substitutions go wrong almost half the time so there&#39;s less food waste when an item is naturally vegan.<br><br>Vic&#39;s makes us (and their staff) work to understand our options so vegans, you&#39;ll need to research Yelp, email, or call to be 100% certain. Luckily, I already knew they have options since I&#39;d been here twice before. They told me they could do a pasta dish with olive oil (yikes) and pizza sans cheese. Pretty sure the last time I was here they were able to make me a pasta with a bunch of veggies in it and red sauce but that wasn&#39;t on the table this time. This is a bummer because that actually filled me up. <br><br>I ordered a pizza without the cheese and after eating the entire pizza I was still hungry (minus 1 star). This happened to me the time before as well. I tried to substitute veggies for cheese but they said they weren&#39;t able to so I had to settle on basil. I also ate a bowl of olives. It was all delicious but the pizza was super unbalanced and overly spicy without something to sub for the cheese. And I love spicy! <br><br>Much to my surprise, I was charged full-price for this spicy situation, so removing a star for that. Meanwhile my friends were swimming in decadence and so full they were practically unbuttoning their pants at the end. I hope they start offering a vegan cheese to make the dishes more filling/balanced and to be more accommodating to people with lactose intolerance and vegans. Slap this change on your menu and your SEO will shoot through the roof - we cannot easily find vegan options without these keywords living on your menus, which translate to review mentions. <br><br>Vic&#39;s I hope you see this as constructive, actionable feedback! You&#39;re definitely a trusty spot but it&#39;s a bummer that all three times I&#39;ve visited in left hungry while my friends need to be rolled out the restaurant.

If you are spending $26 on eggs Benedict (of which I only got 1 egg on top of 1 crab cake no sides other than wilted spinach underneath, like no potatoes etc) and $18 on a margarita, you should be able to customize based on your needs (I have an intolerance to tequila ).

Couldn&#39;t quite pin it. The pickled onion helped because it overrode the flavor. At the end I ate the salad and 1/4 to 1/3 of the jerk chicken.. the rest got tossed bc we weren&#39;t able to finish. \u00a0Also, it&#39;s pretty spicy on its own (which I appreciate) so consider before adding harissa sauce to it.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 1, "reviewCount": 12, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "10/18/2023", "comment": {"text": "Food is expensive but the food is flavorless.

However, as my friend walked away to the restroom before we left to check out another restaurant, one of the hostesses was kind enough to let us have a table by the bar! Amazing!<br><br>I am so glad we were able to stay. Despite the unexpected noise level and crowdedness (people standing all around us, since we were by the bar), we were able to enjoy our delicious dinner and craft cocktails! <br><br>I have nothing new to say that others have not already said, but want to emphasize that they care about their craft and use fresh high-quality ingredients for both food and beverages.

From the outside looking in, it does look like a tourist trap, especially because of its proximity to Times Square. But they had good reviews, and the menu looked good and was reasonably priced, especially for that area. We ordered:<br><br>-Assorted Brazilian Hors d&#39;ouevres - this was an assortment of 6 different empanadas/croquettes with various meat/cheese/rice filling. Some were good but there were a few I didn&#39;t like. I don&#39;t even know what was what because nothing was explained to us. But its a fun dish to share between two people if you want to try a little bit of all the flavors. This was served with a side of some chili/tomato oil, which was really good but if you can&#39;t take spice, this dip isn&#39;t for you<br>-Feijoada Complete (black bean stew with fresh and dried beef, salted and fresh pork, bacon, sausage and ribs, served with collard greens, rice, sliced orange and farofa) - we shared this and it&#39;s definitely enough for two people. I didn&#39;t care for the beef, but love the pork because it was tender, and the sausage as well. The collard greens were a nice garlicky tradition. I&#39;ve never had feijoada before but having stew with orange was new to me but it was actually kind of refreshing and cut some of the richness of the stew. I didn&#39;t care for the farofa (toasted cassava flour). It reminded me of eating nutritional yeast. We wanted a bit more carbs to go with the rest of the stew and the cheese bread would have been great to soak up all the sauce but unfortunately, this was sold out. How can you sell out of cheese bread before a dinner rush! We ended up getting fried bananas, which I do not recommend. We thought it would be like fried plantains but it was literally battered and fried halves of bananas, kind of like the banana tempura you would get at a sushi restaurant.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I liked this place enough to come back for a second visit, but it was a great first experience.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": 169, "reviewCount": 67, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "10/18/2023", "comment": {"text": "Had lunch at \u00a0Via Brasil in Manhattan today after a wonderful workshop Star Mothers &amp; Earth Ancestors: A Channeling Event for Starseeds with Marissa &amp; JJ Brighton.

The Brazilian sausage was wonderfully juicy, succulent, and had just the right chewy consistency. The pork chop was also tasty, and was very well seasoned. The chicken was probably my least favorite, because I&#39;m not normally impressed by it. This chicken was decent and was pleasantly soft, but a little on the bland side.<br><br>The rice was perfectly cooked and usually I&#39;m not really a fan of beans, but paired with the rice, it was pretty good. I also enjoyed the yucca flour mix, which had a sandy consistency, along with raisins and veggies. This was a nice blend, especially eaten together with the pico de gallo and meats.

Beyond the large regular menu, there were several specials, which was super great. <br><br>THE FOOD: I ordered Chicken Milanesa off the specials menu which was a breaded chicken dish with mashed potatoes.

The Manager ended up calling us and we were able to verify that the phone was in fact ours and they got our address and shipped it to our home with a tracking number included. My husband and I were thrilled and blessed for Waheed and Alaa. We insisted on sending a check or a gift at the least to show our gratitude but he refused and would not accept anything. The least I can do for these gentlemen is to leave an amazing review for the restaurant and acknowledge WAHEED and ALAA for their amazing act of kindness and honesty. <br><br>Besides these two amazing staff, I would also like to comment that they had amazing pizza and calzone!

I cannot do the disservice of tricking you to eat at this place.<br><br>I was going to a dance studio for some Argentine Tango and had about an hour or so to kill so I walked around Times Square and found this place which looked pretty clean and legit. I walked inside and it felt like a Sbarro, but nicer with a smoothie bar. Okay, all good so far, so where the heck do they get the one star?<br><br>You&#39;re here for food and prices. If you&#39;re a New Yorker, pizzas and all things Italian are held sacred and kept at a higher standard than anything else. If your pizza tastes like cardboard, it had better be dirt cheap.

Well, it&#39;s because this is a PIZZA store and that sacred bond is upheld for everything that they sell, including the chicken ranch stromboli that I ordered. It cost over $8 for the tiniest wrap thing that I had ever seen. It was dripping in oil and looked like there was nothing stuffing it. What made it worse was that when I was about to order, there was a group of Japanese people giving back their plates of pizza because their order was to-go. The server took the pizzas off those plates and put my stromboli on one of them. Now, normally it&#39;s not a huge deal and I prefer that they not waste things, but I count it as a check against them rather than for them because everything here just felt slimy.<br><br>The stromboli, as I suspected, was dry inside and the cheese was hard from having sat outside all day. The oil covering the thing was like a layer of sunscreen - thick, congealed, and sticky. I was not a huge fan of this meal. If it was at the very least large, then I could somewhat forgive them for getting my money&#39;s worth, but it was the size of a puny hot pocket.

Before seeing a movie the other weekend a friend placed me in charge of finding a happy hour. The bar I picked next door was packed to the gills and then we saw a street sign that said $5 beers/wine. Sold. The name of the place confused me. The sign on their shop says in big letters &#34;Beer Cheese&#34;. So that&#39;s what I figured was the name of the place but it&#39;s really &#34;Vintner Wine Market&#34;. <br><br>Small selection of house wines and beers on tap for $5 but they also have plenty of bottles for a $2 corking fee. Kind of average priced out. Nothing too out of the ordinary and a really decent selection of craft beers. The one thing I didn&#39;t like is that the people that work here really push for you to have table side service so that you have to eventually pay a higher tip plus tax. I kind of just wanted to grab a beer, pay for it and can totally bring it to the table myself yet they insist on serving you. But it was all good because my friends also wanted to eat. <br><br>The selection of meats and cheeses sold here are also pretty glorious. You can take meat and cheese cuts to go as well as bottles. To keep in mind the beer here is more accurately priced than a lot of delis I find in this neighborhood that will overcharge you for crap like &#39;Blue Moon&#39;. Get out of here. <br><br>There is an actual dining in food menu with tons of salads, sandwiches, paninis, soups, fondue, and cheese plates, etc. The sandwiches come out ENORMOUS so my friend insisted I ate half of his. We had the signature Mozzarella sandwich with tomato, basil, greens, olive oil, and added on prosciutto. It was so fresh and the prosciutto was tastier than I&#39;ve had at sit down restaurants. My friend&#39;s wife went with a fancy grilled cheese that was filled with brie, cheddar, manchego, basil, and tomato. She said it was too cheesy and I immediately phased into &#39;I have no idea who these people are&#39; mode. Is there truly such a thing as too much cheese?! I tried a bite. It was beyond great. She ordered a salad to make up for it and was happy. I was drunk and started eating marinated olives. I hate olives typically but these were solid.

We proceed to wait for our food and questioned the girl behind the counter about the Balsamic Chicken Wrap, as to whether it was coming out freshly made or were we expected to take one out of the refrigerated case. She did not have a clue and decided that no answer was sufficient. Another employee appeared at this time looking very annoyed and ranting about something. She proceeded to make a panini for someone. At this time I asked to speak to the Manager. I told him of our quandary and he said that that if there was a wrap in the case that we should take it. I explained to him that this is not what we were expecting and so he asked the &#39;annoyed&#39; employee to prepare the wrap, and offered us a free beverage or salad for our troubles. The woman makes the wrap, hands it to us on a plate(for takeout) and we got out of there as fast as we could.

The meat was shredded into pieces already, and was perfectly tender, juicy, well seasoned, as well as filled with amazing flavor. I also enjoyed the rice, which was cooked just the right amount.

We read tons of reviews about how great the margaritas are here but we have to disagree they&#39;re equivalent to any margarita you&#39;d get at Applebees or another chain restaurant.

The cucumber marg tasted like they threw a full cucumber (skin and all) into the blender which isn&#39;t a bad thing it&#39;s actually nice to order a flavor and it not just be a hint of flavoring or a super sweet syrup mimicking that flavor. The same went for the peach and tamarind margs - they tasted exactly like their flavors promised. However, it would be nice if any of them tasted like they were alcoholic.

Next, the Birria Tacos, they were a little dry but the consume made it taste much better. The Birria quesadillas were good but by far the best option out of our choices was the mushroom quesadilla (and I&#39;m not even a mushroom fan). The best part of our entrees was the guy who delivered them to the table. He described everyone&#39;s dishes and sauces before leaving the table.

The salsa was pretty good, nice and flavorful, but the chips were the star of this. They are crispy and not overly greasy. You can definitely tell that they are homemade. <br><br>We also ordered the yucca fries and as someone who could live off of condiments, I appreciate the fact that they serve these crispy sticks of heaven with FOUR dipping sauces. I&#39;m glad to look up what they are for the review because I can admit I had no idea what on earth I was eating at the time: mole, aji amarillo, kalamata olive, and chipotle AIOLIs. They were all so good I just wish there were more fries to scoop up that shit. <br><br>I was pleased to see some vegetarian tacos on the menu: the cauliflower tacos with roasted ancho-Chile cauliflower, poblano pepper, onion, tomato, baby arugula, salsa verde, avocado, and radish on corn tortillas. These bad boys were STUFFED to the point where I literally could barely pick them up. There was definitely a ton of flavor here but as I&#39;m not keen on onions, I wasn&#39;t head over heels for said flavor and relinquished the third taco to GF. <br><br>Just to top everything off, GF ordered a side of beans and rice which comes with that white chunky cheese. You really can&#39;t go wrong with this one anywhere but they did us right here. <br><br>Service was good and food came out quickly.

I think any fan of the original dish would be impressed. The oxtail came with two sides. The mac and cheese had nice texture. Vegan cheese isn&#39;t always the best, but this dish was creamy and tasty. I also got the rice and peas, which perfectly complemented the oxtail. <br><br>I also ordered the Tunnel sandwich which might be one of the best vegan chicken sandwiches I have ever had. Fried vegan chicken was smothered in a spicy buffalo sauce and ranch with lettuce, tomato, and pickles. It was messy and delicious, served on a burger bun. The chicken was crispy on the outside with a pleasantly chewy, juicy inside. <br><br>My only complaint was the portion sizes. They were generous with the numerous pieces of oxtail, but the sides were quite small. For $17, the sandwich was also way smaller than I was expecting. With a name like the &#34;Tunnel&#34; I was expecting more of a long sub. <br><br>Still, this restaurant is a must try for all!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 195, "reviewCount": 214, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "4/9/2023", "comment": {"text": "Imma give this place a solid 2.5.

We made a list of vendors that we wanted to see and came early right when the festival started. We had a game plan to tackle as much vendor booths before it got busy. The booths that we definitely wanted to check out was Vegan Dots (my favorite), These Wingz? (from Chicago), Freakin&#39; Vegan, Monks Meats, Avocaderia, Van Leeuwen, Los Loosers (from Mexico), Daiya and Seasoned Vegan. <br><br>When we first passed the gates, there was security that searched bags to rid of any food and drinks. Our brand new water bottle waters was confiscated =(... <br>But, next time, I will bring an empty drink canister because it turned out they had a free water station to refill which came in handy. <br><br>There was so much good food here and was definitely worth the ticket. There was a few vendors that handed out free samples for taste testing, which was nice and I actually discovered new options because of it. It would have been nice if the festival handed out swag bags with samples, coupons and snacks already to introduce us to new vendors. Although I did bring a backpack, it would have been much easier to have had a tote bag to easily toss things in the bag than having to swing my backpack around just to dump free goodies and pamphlets inside. <br><br>Definitely glad I wore comfy shoes because there was a lot of walking and standing in lines...plus we walked across the bridge to get to Randall&#39;s Island. Even after eating so much good food, I ended up losing a couple pounds the next day in result from all that walking. Yay!<br><br>They had really good music and some games, volleyball, some photo props to get your instagram worthy photos. <br><br>When we first arrived here, our game plan was that we went to every single booth (before purchasing anything) and taste tested out all the free stuff and made note of the booths that we wanted to come back to purchase stuff. We wanted to tackle all the out of town vendors first over the locals, just in case we were not able to check all of them out, we know that we can at least visit the locals anytime. Then after taste testing all the free stuff, we all separated and went to our &#34;go to&#34; booths to stand in the semi-crazy long lines (during the time) and reunited...had a lunch picnic and shared all our food together. By the time we finished eating all our stuff, we were so full! I&#39;m so happy we did that because by the time we finished our food, the park was so busy and all the lines that we had previously stood in line were crazzzzzy long. There were some vendors that tackled the lines quickly by having a separate line for cash and a separate line for credit (smart move!) and there were some vendors that had a long line that just didn&#39;t have enough help. <br><br>I&#39;m glad we came early, because clearly a lot of the time is wasted standing in line.<br><br>All and all we had a good time and I&#39;m looking forward to next year&#39;s festival. <br><br>~~~~~~~~~<br><br>*** TIPS to know: <br><br>- Bring an empty drink canister, they had a free drinking water station to refill with water<br>- Sunscreen (if outdoors) I had put sunscreen on beforehand, but...still got sunburned after several hours<br>- Backpack or tote bag<br>- Picnic blanket<br>- Comfy shoes<br>- A copy of the vendor lists that you want to check out<br>- Tag team with friends, lines are long..have a few of your friends stand in different lines and then come together to share your food together.

I had heard of this pizzeria from various sources, but refused to add it to my famous pizza project, as I needed a bit more dark horses and less of the main stream. I got myself on the L train and made it my business to give it a go, even in 97 degree heat. This is one pizza that must rank among top tourist spots, but not for the reason that you may think.<br><br>I will explain why, in the form of each slice getting its own respect of a paragraph. I got three slices, a Margherita, a Plain, and a Pepperoni Square. Heck, for $13, that is a delicious deal.<br><br>Margherita: The pizza arrives, hot off the oven, onto my paper plate. I could not yet hold this, as the slice was still hot upon first touch, and first bite, burned the top of my mouth. So now I make do like a Ben and Jerry&#39;s ice cream pint, going on mouth feel. The crust is very crispy, but a bit well done to my liking. Nice beautiful air pockets, but still, a well done crust. The cheese is flavorful and stringy, the sauce is a typical Margherita sauce. The thropple in this pizza slice works well, and makes it all pretty good. I nod in approval for this one.<br><br>Plain slice: Thirty seconds later, I try to try this slice. Again, I foolishly burn my hand and mouth as the slice is still too hot to pick up. I try a Squidward sized bite. Cheese is stringy, lots of cheese on this slice, the sauce is too sweet. Beautiful crust, but again, it is on the well done side. I try to eat this slice without burning myself and each time I burn myself. How I finished this slice with all my fingers intact remains to be seen. Could have went without this one if I had a redo, but it is a solid slice if you are looking for one.<br><br>Pepperoni Square: Intimidating, intoxicating, just one of those slices I looked at with interest and in trepidation. Just to be safe, I take a bite of a pepperoni cup. Already I am transported to another part of this universe. So good. So salty. So porky. So cheesy. I had heard they crust them with parmesan cheese. They do and it works. I had to also think about this. Is this slice better than Prince St Pizza? The short answer is yes. It is bigger. The Mike&#39;s Hot Honey is a delight.

Ludhianvi Lamb Curry is a wonderful curry as a main while Shalgam Saag is one of my favorite interpretations of this dish in the city. Would recommend the Teekan Murg also for spice heads. For biryani, order the lamb or jackfruit. Goat has too many bones.<br><br>I have been to this excellent Indian restaurant a few times bringing a group and having joined others. The food here is excellent overall. In general I would say that their most successful dishes are anything involving the Tandoor but there aren&#39;t many faults in their mains either. As per normal, they gave some papadum and the normal assortment of chutneys after we ordered. They have wine and the usual lassi along with a homemade ginger drink which is essentially a less sweetened version of Limca and it it&#39;s quite refreshing. The review below is based on my most recent experience where I essentially ordered for a group of five people with the only doubling of any dish being the chicken bukhni and it came out to around $35-$40 a person with some leftovers.<br><br>For appetizers, we went with the achari chicken tikka, chicken bukhni, and bhel puri. I&#39;ve also had their lamb kebab (excellent) and Amritsari Macchi (aka fried fish) which is also very good<br><br>Achari Chicken Tikka- Tandoor grilled boneless chicken cubes marinated with pickling spices, served with cilantro &amp; mint chutney ($10) <br>This is an excellent moist chicken dish with my only complain being that maybe the pickling spices could be a bit stronger. While I would say that Gazab has a better version, this is pretty good as well.<br><br>Chicken Bukhni- Tandoor grilled blackened chicken cubes marinated in mustard oil, dry red chilies, Indian green chilies &amp; jalapeno peppers, served with homemade pineapple chutney. ($10) <br>This is a more fiery tandoor dish as per the description with a much stronger char. The chicken is coated in spices and I prefer it over the achari version. The pineapple chutney they make works wonderfully cutting down the heavy spices. Would highly recommend.<br><br>Bhel Puri- Crispy rice puffs tossed with chopped onion, tomatoes, mint and tamarind chutney, sprinkled with chickpea noodles. ($7) <br>Alright cheap version. I think the chutneys could be a little bit stronger at least in comparison to other bhel puris I have had. Fine.<br><br>For mains, I went with an assortment of dishes. I&#39;ve also had their butter chicken which was fine and aloo gobi which was very good.<br><br>Shalgam Saag- Mustard green &amp; spinach cooked with turnips, flavored with ginger-garlic, onion &amp; tomato. ($16) <br>This is probably my favorite interpretation of saag in the city. The extra vegetables cooked in add a delicious extra flavor while the turnips work for texture. Would highly recommend.<br><br>Ludhianvi Lamb Curry- Sonny&#39;s hometown favorite, boneless lamb cubes in a rich gravy flavored with ginger garlic, fenugreek leaves, bay leaf, and cinnamon sticks. ($20)<br>This is apparently a tribute to Punjab and what a wonderful tribute this is. Very tender lamb in a rich delicious curry. This is my favorite of the meat mains.<br><br>Teekhan Murg- Boneless chicken cubes cooked in Jamaican peppers &amp; red pepper gravy. ($18) <br>If you are in into chili, this is a very spicy dish (I presume said peppers are Scotch Bonnets or something similar.) Nice tender chicken and the spice helped elevate other dishes but I&#39;m not sure if I would order this solely.<br><br>Goat Biryani- Steamed basmati rice, layered with goat on the bone, flavored with saffron, rose water, plum seeds &amp; fragrant spices. ($20.) <br>This was probably the only just alright dish we had. The spices of the biryani were wonderful but there are way too many bones. Would instead recommend the lamb (which is boneless) or jackfruit as you&#39;re getting the same wonderful spices but you&#39;re actually able to eat everything. <br><br>For breads, we got the Aloo Paratha, Chili Garlic Naan, and Spinach and Cheese Amritsari Kulcha. All three of the breads are delicious with my favorite being the kulcha due to the filling. The paratha could use more potato while the chili garlic naan was excellent. All three were good and they all arrived with four pieces. We also ordered a side of rice which was $4 what is the expected price for the area. <br><br>The food here has been delicious every time I&#39;ve been here. While I potentially would not recommend the goat biryani just because there were too many bones, the rest of the food has been amazing with special notes going to the dishes I listed in the mini review.

They have a wide range of authentic Ukrainian foods and also some more traditional breakfast/brunch options. I ordered the Stand with Ukraine Bowl ($21), which came with 6 pierogis of 3 different varieties with grilled kielbasa sausage and some bacon bits on top. The pierogis were all high quality, and I especially like the sauerkraut mushroom one. The potato one was a bit plain but that is to be expected. It would&#39;ve been better if there was more kielbasa/bacon or something else to go with this though. Also, the menu said that there was supposed to be caramelized onions in the bowl, but I didn&#39;t have any. Important to note that the proceeds from the sale of this particular bowl go to Ukrainian Relief Efforts, which is an added bonus during these times.<br><br>I also tried the Stuffed Cabbage (Holubtsi), which was stuffed with beef, pork, and rice with mushroom gravy on top and Ukrainian beet and horseradish salad as the chosen side. I appreciated the uniqueness and authenticity of this dish, which was very tasty. It was actually more of the stuffing than the cabbage itself, and the mushroom gravy was particularly good. I would also say that this beet and horseradish salad is a bit of a strong flavor to eat by itself, but goes very well together with the stuffed cabbage. For $21, this was a fair price.<br><br>The restaurant does not take reservations and is pretty popular during peak hours, so there can be some wait times expected but nothing too crazy. I came during a slightly off-peak time and had to wait around 10 minutes. The interior is pretty large with lots of seating and they have a decent amount of outdoor seating as well. The interior is decorated with lots of Ukraine-themed decor, as expected, which adds to the authentic feel of the restaurant.<br><br>It seems that this already-popular restaurant has gained even more popularity in recent times as people show their support for Ukraine.

Bread service here is bomb, but who doesn&#39;t love freshly-baked croissants. Small plates were kind of disappointing -- salted beets are worth the reorder, but the crudo lacked flavor and acid, the tempura oysters were giving just tempura, and the half shell maine scallop was past the tipping point of rich from the uni and mint butter.<br> <br>Always a sucker for schnitzel, we ordered the Jagerschnitzel, which swaps veal for chicken and has a nice rich mushroom sauce made with porcini and chanterelles. And you can never go wrong with breakfast for dinner, so definitely don&#39;t sleep on the lobster omelette. The omelette was very light with smoked artic char caviar, a bright lemon sauce, and crispy hand-cut frites on the side, just perfection.<br> <br>They should go to jail for that meringue and carrot cake, but the salted pistachio soft serve gelato was nicely spun and had a great nuttiness to it. Fair warning, the soft serve is definitely fit for more than two people, and you can order all four flavors (they also have Raspberry, Araguani Venezuelan Chocolate, and Avocado Coconut) versus doing what we did in mistakenly ordering just one flavor.<br> <br>Although it was a mixed bag, Ver\u014dnika does have some good bites, so inevitably you won&#39;t have to exclusively drink your calories here.<br>--------<br>IG: @dinelikeaduchess", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 44, "reviewCount": 80, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "4/11/2023", "comment": {"text": "Came here to celebrate my good god mom&#39;s birthday.

Are you looking for a place that still holds mystery in a world full of restaurant vlogs? The Veronika still holds that air. Greeting at the door? Check. Walking up a sweeping staircase? Check. Hassle free coat check? Check. Walking through an immaculate bar with the perfect mood lighting to be led to the dramatic yet well spaced out dining room? Big check! If you couldn&#39;t tell by my checklist, the Veronika has it all. My experience the past couple of times I have dined here has even prompted me to consider membership! The vibes are that immaculate. With a well thought out dining menu as well as a great variety in both their cocktail and wine list, Veronika has something for everyone. They were even able to provide viable offerings and substitutions for someone in my party who was gluten free (here&#39;s looking at you fresh gluten free bread served with their usual mini croissants!) My recommendations? For appetizers, the scallop and kampachi and the tuna tartare are amazing and refreshing to start. I&#39;d go for any of their steak dishes for an entree - the ribeye is especially flavorful - and they all come with delicious frites. And lastly, you cannot leave until you&#39;ve tried their Martini and caviar potato offering as a cocktail. Long story short, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Veronika - if you can get an 8pm reservation when the space seems to really come alive, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

We were delighted to actually see Tom at the counter expediting (maybe cooking?) food - we even took some faraway/creepy/stalkerish photos. <br><br>The food can be described as homey Italian. Overall, almost everything was good but nothing really blew our minds. However for the prices (most entrees were sub $30), we were happy to try out a Chef Tom restaurant (and have an opportunity to see him!) without blowing the bank.<br><br>- Veal tongue - my favorite dish! It was so tender and rich in flavor. They were very generous with the slices too so it made for a hearty appetizer. The salsa verde on top also brought a bright, acidic pop to the dish and I found myself liking it more and more with each bite. <br>- Meatballs were also really good - it was so savory and tender! The sauce also made each bite so succulent and juicy - one of our other favorites of the night. <br>- Radicchio salad was very fresh and herbalicious - I like the little orange slices and the light citrus and olive oil dressing. Overall I enjoyed it - but would I order this salad again? Probably not.<br>- Cavatelli - probably the most disappointing dish I&#39;ve eaten in a while. The pasta was almost a little too al dente. It was supposed to be an oxtail cavatelli yet there was almost no oxtail in it other than small ribbons in the sauce. My protein-loving fiance was very disappointed with the lack of protein in this dish (&#34;if I wanted a vegetarian pasta, I would have gone with the cacio e pepe&#34;). I was also not a fan of the giant rosemary that&#39;s kind of floating in the middle of the dish (rosemary: good for flavoring but not for chewing or eating).<br>- Braised chicken - it&#39;s almost like Mexican shredded chicken. The sauce is a bit subdued after eating the vibrant sauce of the meatballs. The dish was tender and juicy but missing a certain wow factor. My fiance loved it because there was (1) a lot of chicken and (2) the price was only $25 for a protein entree.<br>- Olive oil cake was a simple dessert but it was a good combo with the tart strawberries and sweet whipped cream - satisfying end to the dinner.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 1, "reviewCount": 113, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "5/15/2022", "comment": {"text": "This passion project of TOP CHEF judge Tom Collichio, located one door east of his flagship Craft, gets and deserves my best rating and is one of the best values I&#39;ve ever found.<br>Named for his family&#39;s ancestral village in the mountains east of Naples, Vallata features simple regional fare, beautifully prepared.<br>I went twice this past week, once alone, once with a date.

Instead there were concert posters and framed blow-up photos of Blondie and the Beastie Boys on the walls, but most importantly, there was the owner&#39;s record collection which they said numbered over two thousand.<br><br>Their gimmick was that they provide a leather-bound catalog listing all the album titles by artist (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3Tnu1cu&amp;s=8ac75a325a85346eb1dff771320c4ba61646cc657e5081c54cfe5a206b35515b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3Tnu1cu</a>). Since Jamie W. and I were the evening&#39;s first diners, we got to choose the first album. I went with &#34;Aretha&#39;s Greatest Hits&#34;. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Find out what it means to me. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Take care, T-C-B. It definitely put us in the right mood for a casual fine dining experience.<br><br>Familiar favorites on the speakers matched the vibe of the place and the approach in the traditional American menu. We started with cocktails first, of course. Jamie went with the $18 Magickal Childe, which they described rather mysteriously as &#34;If you know, you know&#34;. It had Empress Gin, Cointreau, and lemon juice with a brown sugar rim on a martini glass. A bit on the sweet side for me.<br><br>I ordered the more familiar $18 Rose Negroni with Bombay Sapphire, Bombay Bramble, Luxardo Bitter, and Martini Rubino. Quite satisfying with a kick (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3MMSYvH&amp;s=9cabf204521ccabd97bef252d8ac72c5212ba98738b9677660beacd23e75245f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3MMSYvH</a>). For our appetizers, Jamie ordered the $19 Vinyl Chopped Salad, a robust plate of romaine, iceberg, hard-boiled egg halves, cubes of fresh mozzarella, smoked bacon, prosciutto, and tomato slices drizzled with a sweet vinaigrette (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3zmPfj1&amp;s=d77bdd6a4fb4b7a166032a250e184c927c223ef054c8522eb7ff94aa9d09b00b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3zmPfj1</a>).<br><br>Good, straightforward plate suitable at a high-end deli. I went with the $17 Classic Caesar which was true to its name with big romaine hearts, grilled house croutons, shaved parmesan, and grape tomatoes. It was drenched in a Caesar garlic dressing (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3VF7jON&amp;s=60d7e0cfb08808d400aa1ef86d080761cc2c03c5da7da09380fbc38895ee0ffc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3VF7jON</a>). Well done though I did miss the fresh anchovies. We were surprised they offered sushi options albeit stylized to suit a steakhouse.<br><br>I had my eyes on the $69 Bone-In Ribeye but was told they were out that evening. Instead the bubbly server sold me on the $66 16-oz Cajun Dry Rubbed Ribeye (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3VLNPrz&amp;s=9fdbcdc09db422e6fa480c7c1524e941675347a22fb47d6291871544e15ef8bc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3VLNPrz</a>). It was prepared to my preference of medium rare, and it was quite tender with a nice char. Jamie was less indulgent and had the $44 Scallops, four of them jumbo-sized accompanied by a cauliflower pur\u00e9e, crispy prosciutto, and roasted cauliflower (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3SlGXhJ&amp;s=d1953ef738513eddaacbbae0d5bba1406dfbf86db9e1272620bd767d4b9189c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3SlGXhJ</a>).<br><br>Drizzled with a thick and tantalizing balsamic lemon vinaigrette, it was pretty tasty and surprisingly filling for surf versus turf. We had side dishes as well. The first was the $15 Roasted Butternut Squash with cauliflower and goat cheese (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3TnFzMQ&amp;s=a967a6d5ac3a63aab65092d31dcc1c74ae9ac8ea9c2813d20b1c5a165173bb4e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3TnFzMQ</a>).

It was just the right healthier side compared to all the indulgences.<br><br>Believe it or not, we ended up sharing dessert rather than each of us getting our own. It turned out to be a smart move as the $15 Upside Diwn Apple Pie was plenty. It featured dried cranberries, Gran Marnier, a cinnamon glaze, and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3CUqStB&amp;s=618856dd1dff4d0d8e203d84f5646aeffca6c9762b0e9ea2d19b9d47153cf56a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3CUqStB</a>).

This Chelsea spot advertises casual, but it&#39;s a cool casual. It&#39;s a whole vibe, from staff spinning their or a customer&#39;s selected record album, picked from a wall of racked albums...to a friendly, good looking staff trying to ensure the service provided is personal and first rate. These folks are happy to see you, not just your credit card. <br><br>We started in the cocktail bar with some of their signature drinks...Manhattan Transfers and martinis were nicely made by Allison, who was as friendly and accommodating as her cocktails were delicious. We had the potato croquettes as an appetizer, which were velvety smooth inside and crunchy outside. They were very good lane but even better with their bleu cheese sauce. Unfortunately, hungry hands were faster than my camera. They are the type of good that you remember the next time you walk in. We were taken to our table and greeted by our server, Elizabeth. Again, lovely and friendly just like Allison. We decided to try the Crispy Rice Sushi as I was looking over the wine list. The wine list has plenty to choose from in the usual varietals. Quality and prices range from good wine/decent price to the stupid good/stupid price, I opted for the very good/hey, it&#39;s a restaurant price. One of the two sommeliers and owners, Kevin, was as friendly and helpful as the rest of the Vinyl staff; yes, accommodating and lovely as well...no gender bias here. The were other staff we interacted with that we didn&#39;t catch their names, but they also provided service that greatly impacted the evening positively. But, back to the Crispy Rice Sushi...I was too distracted when it hit the table to ward off my companions in time for a photo. I assure you, four peoples were quite happy to have consumed them. We opted to order the Caesar Salad, Spinach Carbonara and the Loaded Potato Pav\u00e9 as our shared sides. My three beautiful companions all selected the 8 oz Filet Mignons, and I chose the 16 oz Bone-in Ribeye. My companions, historically, only eat 3-4 ounces of their steaks, whether at home or at a restaurant...they each ate at least 3/4s of their steaks tonight, because their filet mignons were so good. If your not familiar with the filet mignon cut, it is generally very lean and tender. Ribeyes, especially bone-in, have more flavorful fat on them. I tasted my wife&#39;s Filet Mignon, it was almost fork tender and very tasty. My Ribeye made my mouth very happy, it made me happy...it was absolutely terrific. We ordered the house steak sauce and marrow herb butter for the table, and while they were good, we felt the steaks were so flavorful that the sauces weren&#39;t needed or wanted. Nothing extra should be put on those steaks, they&#39;re that good. We all enjoyed the Caesar Salad, and the Spinach Carbonara was as well received as it was interesting. The Loaded Potato Pav\u00e9 was quite good and a definite do-over. Although we were all full, Elizabeth suggested we share their apple dessert of the evening. It was kind of a deconstructed apple pie with dried cranberries. We enjoyed the dessert, but just a note regarding personal preferences and cooked fruit. The apples were fresh, not canned or frozen, and were cooked slightly \u00a0al dente. Some folks like their fruit to be softer, others appreciated a little bite and tartness in their apples. To me, it was prepared to my liking. <br><br>To sum up this rather lengthy review...this place was vibing; fun, friendly and very good food.

It was sweet without tipping over to dessert land. The peach is marinated/cooked so that it&#39;s a little soft but not mushy. There is still brightness. Cocao nibs and macadamia nuts added good texture and subtle earthiness to the dish. Don&#39;t see this combination elsewhere, so I appreciate the creativity. <br><br>Brussel sprouts salad. Didn&#39;t like the brussel sprouts part of the dish. It seemed pretty raw which was tough to eat especially the middle parts. The cheddar, cashew, and rye crumble at the bottom was the best part. It was toasty but not too hard. <br><br>Cactus salad was my least favorite of the salads. They use sesame oil or something of the likes in the dressing, and I don&#39;t particularly like that. I expected catcus to come served as a whole pad or in big slices, not diced up like now. Dicing takes away the unique shape and texture. The avocado and tomatoes match but less special. <br><br>Tartines were bigger and more loaded than expected. Using focaccia bread is good for taste but structurally the dimples made it less sturdy between bites. The toasting wasn&#39;t overdone making the bread too stiff for biting. <br>Heirloom tomatoes was very sweet and juicy. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of dill but it wasn&#39;t too over powering here. The prosciutto on top is good for a kick of savoriness but as always there&#39;s the issue of clean bites between tendons. <br>Avocado comes with a whole buttery avocado. The beet puree added good color and subtle sweetness. Pumpkin seeds gave gentle texture. <br><br>Spanish tortilla. Naive us thought it was taco type of stuff. Anyway the eggs and potato were under seasoned, not sure if it&#39;s intentional. The potatoes had natural sweetness and eggs were hearty but still relatively bland. We didn&#39;t like the romesco sauce which ironically felt too overpowering. Mixed greens were dressed nicely. <br><br>Papperdelle. It was wider than expected. I didn&#39;t like how the pasta texture was a bit rough rather than smooth and bouncy. The sauce is more on the savory warm side with all the olives and capers.

There aren&#39;t a lot of restaurants of this caliber in the Union Square/NYU area--you&#39;re either looking at something thats either quite casual or very upscale. Villanelle found its way onto my radar because I&#39;m always on the lookout for organic/health-conscious dining options that don&#39;t sacrifice flavor and creativity for the sake of making things healthy. Villanelle fits that description perfectly, and then some. Everything about the space feels fresh, warm and inviting. Local, seasonal, organic ingredients. Outstanding cocktail program. Excellent execution on everything. You very well might leave hungry, but I can almost guarantee you&#39;ll still leave with a good taste in your mouth. <br><br>Came here at around 7:45pm on a Friday. The space itself is lovely. Intimate but not romantic. Bright, clean and warm. Just like the food. This is a wonderful spot for a date but equally viable for a chill girl&#39;s night or a place to bring the parents. It feels refined but still down to earth. <br><br>I was planning on sticking wine on this particular night, but then I saw the cocktail menu. What&#39;s up online right now isn&#39;t updated but expect house-made, seasonal ingredients and superb execution. My first drink was a mix of house-made Aquavit, Horseradish and Beets. Woke the palette right up. Very light/fresh. The bf went with a pumpkin-infused rum cocktail, made with egg whites and some other spices, which was sweet and decadent. <br><br>I switched to wine once we started receiving our food. If there&#39;s anything to complain about here, it&#39;s the wine pours. The cocktails here are $14, and that&#39;s about the same as the cheapest glass of wine here. Glasses range from $12-$25, which would be fine if they poured generously. But my two glasses of wine (small glasses, too) were not filled to satisfaction. I&#39;m not being greedy--I scanned the room and saw the same thing at other tables. When you&#39;re charging that much for every single wine offered by the glass, I&#39;d appreciate seeing a bit more of that precious nectar in there. Because they&#39;ve got a solid menu (try the tempranillo). But that&#39;s really my single complaint of the evening, because the service was top-notch overall.<br><br>The service is a big reason why I went with five stars, as it turns out. Everyone who helped us out went above and beyond. About 15 minutes after sitting down, the manager came over and after preemptively apologizing profusely, asked us if we minded moving over one table to help them accommodate a larger party. Not at all, we said. He thanked us and said he&#39;d make sure we&#39;d get a little special something later in the night. Not long after, we received two cocktails that were pretty much my ideal drink--gin/herbaceous with a bit of citrus. <br><br>When it came to food, our waiter asked at the outset whether we had any dietary restrictions and/or preferences. I&#39;m gluten-free and soy-free, which they were quick to accommodate. My bf and I received different types of bread--my gluten-free piece was delicious. I&#39;ve noticed that most restaurants won&#39;t make the option available when it comes to pre-dinner bread, so I appreciated that very much. They also made necessary adjustments when it came to our meal, which made my stomach and small intestines very happy. As was the case with the wine, portion sizes were on the small side. But not egregiously so. Our eats, below: <br><br>Macerated Brussels Sprouts w/ Cheddar, Cashews, Rye: A<br>A really delightful first dish. Rye was served on the side due to gluten (thank you!) but it didn&#39;t make the dish worse for me. Cheddar/cashews added some great nuttiness. Creative and clean.<br><br>Fluke Crudo w/ Pomegranate Seeds: A<br>This isn&#39;t on the only menu so sadly I don&#39;t know what the yummy pink sauce was underneath. But it was damn good. Fish was fresh and paired wonderfully with the pomegranate. Clean flavors, also helped to energize the palette before our heartier dishes. <br><br>Roasted Carrots w/ Carrot Ribbons: A+<br>Comically small portion size here. But man, this was seriously delicious. Carrots done two ways over some decadent spread. Wish I could remember what it was. Maybe squash puree? It was very autumnal and rich. Highly recommend. <br><br>Crispy Octopus w/ Cauliflower, Green Curry, Mint: A+<br>Octopus is one of my very favorite foods and I tend to be quite picky about it. This preparation was unique yet simple. Served with cauliflower and an unbelievable curry, the flavors were beautiful and harmonious and made for a perfect bite. The octopus was just slightly crispy to add some great texture, but not so much so that it overpowered the meat&#39;s essence. <br><br>Arctic Char w/ Sorrel, Caramelized Cream, Dill: A+<br>That caramelized cream is my new Drug of Choice. Wow. The char, as expected, was cooked perfectly. Creamy and rich, yet still light.

At a bare minimum given the circumstances, just charge for the venison (the more expensive of the two) and the memory of the negative aspects of the experience won&#39;t be so strong.<br><br>The dessert menu clearly lacks a pastry chef and relies strongly on panna cotta, churros, and chocolate. Regardless, the churros were an easily approachable and casual finish to the dinner. <br><br>Villanelle appears to have a reasonably priced tasting menu ($80) that I might opt for next time to avoid any service confusion. \u00a0It also may be more cost effective to go that route for both the consumer and restaurant (which makes me wonder why they don&#39;t just commit to a tasting menu only/primarily). Ultimately, Villanelle walks that very fine line of being a functional restaurant, but I think makes enough missteps that it could be hard to significantly differentiate itself. \u00a0I&#39;m in the area enough I&#39;ll almost certainly try it again and I look forward to what changes to my opinion that experience will bring.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": null, "reviewCount": 22, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "12/9/2019", "comment": {"text": "Food was really boring. \u00a0Server recommended the beet tartare. \u00a0It was a stereotypical beets with goat cheese and dill. \u00a0Plated in a perfect circle but the dill wasn&#39;t cut so when we tried to take a bite a large, long piece of dill would come with it. <br><br>On top of that our server was very strange. \u00a0When he would come to the table he would only look at my male friend for the order. \u00a0The backwaiter told the server we had a question and he immediately looked at my friend closely and asked him what the question was. \u00a0Is it possible that a woman could be thinking and have a question to ask? \u00a0It&#39;s not the 1950s anymore. \u00a0Very off putting service.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 1200, "reviewCount": 542, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "5/20/2017", "comment": {"text": "I&#39;ve come to Villanelle a few times now since it opened, the first time on a recommendation while looking for somewhere to eat to celebrate a special occasion.

It is heavenly , even tho I don&#39;t usually like sunchokes! The seasoning and ingredients, while having very different characteristic, orchestra seamlessly, delivering a \u00a0salty sweet symphony. The bright orange, Pearl-like trout roe is the cusp of all these elements, leading to the climax of the performance. Take a forkful of a little bit of everything and let the roe burst in your mouth, blend with the creamy savory symphony. Fireworks! Pairing it with a Riesling cousin from Hungary - furmint sec, works like a charm. <br><br>Also enjoyed very much the raw brussel spouts with cheddar, rye and cashew. The savory, mildly pungent cheddar contrasts well with the nutty sweet sprouts. It is beautifully plated - spring time in a bowl :)<br><br>Main we are sharing the crispy octopus - boiled then flash fried. Juicy tender inside and crispy outside. The accompany, soft and creamy-ish palm and potatoes adding additional layer of texture. An interesting twist of the regular preparation of octopus.

I&#39;ve heard some batches of pasta don&#39;t have enough pepper in it, but fortunately every time I&#39;ve gotten cacio e pepe, the black pepper is the hero. A delicious saltiness comes through from the cheese which just brings the whole pasta dish together. <br><br>We get our food as take out every time because the line is just too long, and the pasta is still so delicious even after it sits in a takeout container for a while. Only downside is there will be a small pool of butter if your takeout gets cold. But honestly don&#39;t care because it&#39;s so worth it. <br><br>For those who aren&#39;t impressed by Via Carotas cacio e pepe, please DM me your recs for better spots.

It was served on its own without side Marinara sauce but oh so delicious. Cooked just right. The seafood was tender while the batter was crispy. Not oily or overly seasoned, this pick was a winner.<br><br>When we got to the Tonno with Beans, it was unlike anything I ever tried.

I can&#39;t even pick up my pizza at times because the thin crust doesn&#39;t support the weight of the toppings (this is a good thing). <br>-Sometimes the pizza isn&#39;t piping hot but just warm, and might require a brief reheating in the oven/toaster. \u00a0Come on people this is NYC in the winter and this is a mom and pop joint. If you want piping hot, order PICKUP. Pro tip: set your oven or toaster oven to boil for between 2-5 minutes until the cheese is fully melted for all delivery cheesy things in life. <br>-Their veggies are awesomely fresh and the chicken is white meat chicken breast. You can conceivably order a pizza that is reasonably healthy if you wanted to. <br><br>PRICING: I don&#39;t think their prices are steep at all. I just tried to duplicate my order on Domino&#39;s and it comes out to about the same. (Seriously...1 star ratings just due to the price hikes?

Seating was tight, but the furs on the seats were a nice touch to keep them warm. They also had some outdoor seating if you prefer that with heaters. In the middle of the meal they raised the lights and turned off the music which was a little bit weird, it looked like someone was trying to wipe down some of the glass on the second floor or something. Ruined a bit of the ambiance during the meal as people commented. That and the service constantly reaching over and around people at intermittent moments to pick up things it was a little strange and also an interruption. It would have been better timed had they done it all at once instead of piecemeal at the table.<br><br>Drinks came quickly enough and they have a few of their own custom drinks. The Vestry looked good, but I was driving so none for me. The lady serving wine didn&#39;t even bother telling me what it was, only asked red or white, which I wish a little more effort to instruct would have been informative.<br><br>The bread was good, although the butter was a little weird, not sure what kind of spices that made it sort of dark and mustard seed patterned. We had a pre fixe menu since we had 11 people. I went with choices that I would not normally make myself or could find it other restaurants. Which is why I didn&#39;t get sushi like dishes for the most part, those are safer but easier to get at other spots.<br><br>Maitake mushrooms with barley had a wonderful consomme and I wish there was a better balance of mushrooms because it felt like it was mostly barley and squash. Pretty good size serving. My colleagues shated their dishes, too, I had a bite of the big eye tuna which was a good tartare with sesame cracker, and the bite of chu toro was solid but not really flashy and something I felt like I could get elsewhere. Wish they didn&#39;t use tuna since I feel like that is endangered.<br><br>For my second course I chose the sushi rice which I had heard so much about, it was brilliant, for the first two bites. Then it was simply overwhelming and a lot of sour and acidic flavor, which overwhelmed in the middle after the second bite all through to the end. Almost tasted like sour mayo at the end. This dish would be much better with a much smaller quantity (just three bites would be good) or less acidity which would then build to the total acidity at the end instead of after two bites and going max throughout. I also had a bite of the hamachi rose which was wonderfully balanced between the pear and the fish, probably one of the best dishes of the night.<br><br>For the main course I had the cod which was cooked really well, super flaky, but almost no other flavor to it which was weird. At the same time I saw the waygu beef was way too overcooked so I guess I&#39;m glad I went with the bland cod. Some people even left multiple pieces on their plate of the waygu. I think the coriander sauce was something I just didn&#39;t enjoy on the cod, but I&#39;m also not a fan of cilantro.<br><br>For dessert I had the orange, which had a satsuma orange and blood orange, but was far too sour to enjoy more than one bite of the panna cotta. I&#39;d expected something creamier and smoother, sweeter really. <br><br>Overall found many of the dishes underwhelming or overwhelming, not really well balanced or improperly portioned. To some extent I had expected to have really small dishes given that it was French inspired, so I did walk out full which was a good thing, but it was a difficult meal to enjoy.

So, for my 8900th review, I&#39;ll recount my experience at Vestry, a stylish one Michelin-starred restaurant in SoHo.<br><br>Commendably, Vestry opened during Covid and looks very ambitious, whether a large indoor dining room or exquisite, even palatial-looking outdoor booths when I stopped by. The menu has a lot of Japanese and seafood influences which were obvious from the start.<br><br>Confusingly, the first course and the amuse-bouches came all at once. Included in these were the tuna tartare (delicious) and the oyster dip (absolutely indulgent), but I completely missed the fact that some exquisite-looking chips were to be used with the oyster dip, which I shamelessly slurped. This was super enjoyable, albeit an overwhelming amount of umami upfront that would have surely been tempered with the chips.<br><br>As for the actual first course, this was a platter of thinly shaved Japanese scallops with kalamansi and sea grapes. Very quickly devoured, but still delightful nonetheless. Enough scallop flavor to be recognizable, but not so much to be &#34;fishy&#34; thanks to the accoutrements.<br><br>The second course, the wagyu beef with potato puree and miso mustard, was also savory and indulgent. Although petite in size (this was pricey wagyu, after all), the beef melted in my mouth in such a sinful way, packing a punch far greater than its physical stature. Very satisfying. <br><br>Finally, a serving of chocolate buche de Noel struck just the right note for the holiday period in which I stopped by. A large portion and simply bursting with moderate sweetness and a medley of textures, whether the chocolate cake or the cr\u00e8me filling. <br><br>At $125 for three courses, fairly reasonably priced given the special holiday menu and the choices on offer. It was ultimately a quick experience (not, say, a drawn-out, two or three hour-long affair) and the pace of service was very rushed, like at the beginning where I had several plates on my table at once.

And wouldn&#39;t you know it? Vestry exceeded my crater-low expectations for New American fine dining. In fact, it scooped up those expectations and flew them up, up in the air like Superman. And now I might actually have to like this type of food.<br><br>The Kampachi Crudo was chef&#39;s kiss and generously portioned. The Wagyu Beef melted in my mouth. The Nova Scotia Halibut was the only entree with an issue, in that the flavors and textures were perfect--but the fish was cold. Like it had been sitting out for too long. Whomp, whomp.<br><br>On to dessert: The Homemade Cheesecake with a mouse was the creamy, adorable, glorious creation I hoped it would be. I wanted five more of it. Not to be outdone, the Chocolate Tart brought all the other flavors of the dessert world to our table, including tart passionfruit, bitter cacao nibs, and pungent chocolate.<br><br>But here&#39;s where Vestry really stood out. The phenomenal service. One person was gluten-free, and they went above and beyond to accommodate her. Including bringing her gluten-free bread and butter (the regular butter has soy sauce in it), so she could eat with us. When they learned it was my birthday, they brought a third dessert on the house: Caramelized Pineapple with meringue. By contrast, the two envious French men sitting next to us did not get a complimentary dessert despite also celebrating a birthday. And just in general, our server was a hoot, and there was much love going around.<br><br>Drinky drink-wise, The Parasol is perfect for lightweights, while the Laugh Now, Cry Later and Bang Bang were the strongest drinks on the menu and perfect for my work-stressed head.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 2, "reviewCount": 11, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "9/26/2023", "comment": {"text": "We had high expectations for this restaurant, but we&#39;re quite disappointed.the dishes \u00a0were over ambitious with too many flavor combinations. \u00a0The specialty bread choices were mushy and uninspired, ask for the plain bread. \u00a0It will take a while for the delivery but worth the wait. \u00a0It seemed every waiter on the floor had been there less than a week and still was in training. \u00a0Over all is was difficult to figure out how they achieved a Michelin mention.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 2}, {"photoCount": 372, "reviewCount": 356, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "6/18/2022", "comment": {"text": "I would give this place a 4/5.

We had our coats checked, and they immediately seated us. They were knowledgeable of all the courses on the menu and had great recommendations. The Sourdough bread was so scrumptious, that they did not mind to bring out more portions for us! The ambiance in this place is down right sexy, and classy, and all you want in a Michelin Star restaurant. We enjoyed every minute of our dinner experience and already planning to come back. <br><br>Food<br><br>Sourdough and miso-seaweed butter: Not an order, they do bring it out for you before the small plates/bites. The butter is.... ugh... no words to describe it. First off, the Sourdough bread comes PIPING HOT, you can see the steam coming out of the load as you unfold the cloth. The bread is soft and has a crispy crust. The butter just spreads on and melts into the bread, making it so addicting to eat. I had to stop myself because I would have gotten full just on the bread and butter. The wait staff was nice enough to offer more portions of the butter and bread. <br><br>Chu Toro: Had a really colorful display with the perfect amount of acidity from the Yuzu to pair with the fatty toro. This was also really refreshing at the same time. We could not get enough of the Yuzu and thoroughly enjoyed the flavors. <br><br>Australian Wagyu Beef: This was cooked to a perfectly medium rare (as requested) with rich umami flavor and scrumptious silky potato puree. The potato puree was so silky and you must smear it on top of the beef as you take your bite. The beef was so juicy and it was the right amount of tenderness that you do not need to chew. <br><br>Risotto: The risotto was definitely the biggest portion of the dishes overall, but it was not too ridiculously overly sized. The risotto could have used a bit more time to cook down, as some pieces were stuck to our teeth, but otherwise it was another delicious dish! It was just the right amount of creaminess, and a nice crunch from the cauliflower. We really enjoyed this and it came out piping hot, so it added points as we ate it. Really recommend this dish. It filled us up pretty good! <br><br>Lastly, we ordered the coconut tapioca (it comes in cold), with bing cherries (little cherry bites and the glaze), with mint. This was surprisingly good. The tapioca is packed underneath in a coconut cream (hardened), and the top is coated with the bing cherries and a glaze/jelly. The sweet, sour, tart, and creamy texture was so scrumptious and amazing end to our meal. <br><br>The drinks are also a must get as well (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). <br><br>Would definitely recommend for trying, thoroughly enjoyed our meals.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 1364, "reviewCount": 183, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "5/22/2022", "comment": {"text": "I always love going to trendy and hip places.

Vatan, naturally, caught my attention when it presented itself as a Thali place. I made reservation (highly recommended) for a Monday dinner. The place is very well laid out and has an antic vibe with graphics from ancient India. The colors and the paintings represent the past very well. The entire restaurant has dim lighting which I felt went well with the decor. <br><br>Talking about the food now, I&#39;ll first point out that the price was exorbitant for a vegetarian Thali ($45 per person with 20% gratuity + taxes). This was one \u00a0of the most expensive Thali restaurant that i&#39;ve ever eaten at. They have appetizers, entree and deserts all very well described in the menu. They have a drinks menu as well which is worth keeping an eye out for. At first, you are introduced to the appetizer Thali which has fried, baked and chaat options. The star of this Thali was Sev Puri along with Ragda Patis (to some extent). You can have unlimited servings of any dishes you like. The next Thali is the Entree Thali and here Chole Puri and Kheer were the clear favorites. The Dal was a typical sweet dal which I didn&#39;t enjoy and the Spinach Bhaji and Ful-Cobi were just ok. Aam Rus was the biggest miss for me, this is available upon request so do request one if you wanna try this (I obviously did), the flavor was just not there and it tasted like a supermarket frozen aam rus. For Deserts (at this point, we were pretty full) we ordered one Gulab Jamun and Masala Chai and you have to try the Chai. It had a tantalizing aroma and was spiced aptly. <br><br>The service was good and restaurant has a unique seating arrangement which is well thought off. The reservation system is handled by Yelp which was a hassle free experience. There is no dedicated parking which should be expected for a NYC restaurant. <br><br>Vatan serves all you can eat Thali food with a great ambiance. For $45 + tax and gratuity, would I say it was worth the money? NO. I understand this is New York and the prices are inflated and such, but for that price point, the food wasn&#39;t comparable. Only a few items on this entire Thali journey were worth recommending (which I outlined) and everything else could be skipped entirely. I would however, rate this place a B-, despite the shortcomings, the restaurant does brilliantly with it&#39;s service and decor along with the fresh and hot puri and home style phulka roti which pairs brilliantly with some entrees. The puri and aamrus combo was a major blow and the Dal had the typical Gujarati sweet flavor which I couldn&#39;t enjoy.

They had a party in front (I believe a firm merger or something similar) and I&#39;ve heard that a lot of spots around here choose this place for their corporate events. As this was the case, we sat in a backroom along with a few other groups but the area back there was nice. The restaurant is way bigger than it looks on the outside and the space inside is comfortable. The server was very friendly and gave good recommendations. They gave us two things at the beginning includingsome bread topped with olives, sun-dried tomatoes (similar to a bruschetta) along with a mix of breadsticks and a loaf. To drink I had the Paper Airplanes which is essentially the same thing as the official cocktail known as the Paper Plane. The drink had bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, and lemon juice and it is one of my favorite cocktails partially since Amaro Nonino might be my favorite type of amaro and therefore one of my favorite drinks in general. The drink has a bitter and sour element with a touch of sweetness and the version here was nice. The server went through a few specials and some of the people partook in them. This included several appetizers as well as several mains with one of them being a beef stew that I might have preferred over my main dish. Some others started with a salad (special avocado, some tomato based one, something else) and someone else got another appetizer which I don&#39;t remember.<br><br>As my dish was $52, I decided to just go with a main dish which was the osso buco with gnocchi as my accompaniment (with the other choice being over over arborio rice) and I got the daily vegetable special as my side dish (which was $10.) The massive dish arrived with the vegetable with the osso buco on the plate and once I let them know, they very quickly replaced it with the gnocchi. They came over with some parmesan to put over the gnocchi which was nice. The braised veal shank fell off the bone and it had a nice richness and very good flavor though I would say that some of the parts weren&#39;t braised enough as there was a little bit too much chew. My only other complaint was that I would have preferred a little bit more gnocchi but the small amount that was there had a perfect texture. My side which was a mix of three vegetables (zucchini, carrots, and spinach I believe also judging by the photo) sauteed in olive oil was alright. The portion size was plenty especially for a nice place like this but the olive oil flavor wasn&#39;t strong enough so I found it slightly bland but the other people enjoyed it as the portion was big enough to share especially with the massive shank. Two other people got the buzara which is a Croatian (specifically Dalmatian) stew which is either in a red (na crveno) or white (na bijelo) sauce and they loved it. I didn&#39;t try as there was some squid in there as it was with mixed seafood. I tried the Tortellini Alla Berulia which consisted of said pasta with a bolognese sauce and some mushrooms and they were perfectly al dente and I would maybe get an appetizer and get that as my main next time.<br><br>For dessert, I went with the peach sorbet stuffed into it&#39;s own fruit shell or sorbetto alla pesca di ripieno I believe. There was also the same thing with lemon sorbet as well as a flourless chocolate cake, tartufo, and something else (I think a cheesecake but I&#39;m not sure.) The dessert was presented nicely and it was very tasty. I&#39;m unsure if they use some brand or something but I found it tasty. I believe it was maybe $10 or something similar. <br><br>The food here was good. Nothing extraordinary but then again I don&#39;t tend to find Northern Italian food to be the best.

In all fairness, the couple pointed at us multiple times saying we had gotten there first, but the host insisted on seating them. Granted, loyalty is great, but we also live in the area. As a couple many decades younger than the average clientele, we could also be potential regulars...now, not so much.<br><br>Apart from the host, the service was decent. We shared the Clams Oreganata which they thoughtfully split into two portions before it got to our table. We ordered the Farfalle ai Scampi and the Buzara (traditional Dalmatian seafood stew). The farfalle was supposed to have truffle oil but we tasted none. The buzara was delicious and the seafood was plenty. However, the shrimp in both of our dishes were cooked beyond death. They were so rubbery and hard that I couldn&#39;t look past it (hence the 3.5 stars and not higher). I wonder if it&#39;s because that&#39;s how the regulars like it, because the rest of the seafood (calamari, mussels, clams etc.) were cooked perfectly. <br><br>We shared homemade tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious.

He says to me, wow- looks like we are really in for a treat with being rated 21st best Italian restaurant in Manhattan. \u00a0I couldn&#39;t help my self ( through experience all too often) but said due to my thousands of meals out, let&#39;s hope they live up to it. \u00a0He rolled his eyes at me, like I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. <br>My meal came out looking quite foreign-breaded &amp; deep fried, basically the opposite of what I ordered. \u00a0I immediately sent it back as I am gluten free &amp; not what I ordered. <br>My friend was eating his linguine in white clam sauce &amp; he proceeds to tell me the pasta isn&#39;t cooked! He&#39;s eating it anyway, something I am not capable of doing. \u00a0Anyway, he continues eating and finally says- &#34;I can&#39;t do it, it&#39;s that awful and the clams are undercooked &amp; taste bad (old clams.) He sends it back &amp; asks for bolognese instead. They were accommodating without being rude. Something hard to come by these days. <br>We are fine sitting &amp; relaxing with our wine. \u00a0All of a sudden I hear these &#34;zap,zap&#34; noises. \u00a0I was facing the kitchen and see a man with a Zap racket killing bugs! He&#39;s swinging the Zapper all through the air &amp; the Zapping was instant. \u00a0He want on doing this a good 10 minutes with no end in sight. With every zap my stomach turned- I&#39;m talking about 100 or so. \u00a0It seemed there was no end. \u00a0And there wasn&#39;t. I finally looked at my friend &amp; said I can&#39;t stay here, I&#39;m nauseated with their big infestation- and in &amp; around the kitchen as well. <br>We walked out without waiting for our food, very annoyed &amp; hungry. Of course left money for the wine &amp; beer on the table. <br>I can&#39;t imagine this will be open for business much longer. \u00a0They don&#39;t know what they are doing &amp; id have to think it was sold during or post-COVID and will never be the same.<br>Don&#39;t waste your time or your money.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 608, "reviewCount": 193, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "5/28/2022", "comment": {"text": "Horrible \u00a0horrible horrible Italian restaurant and clueless server.

Finally, the waitress (the same person as the receptionist) appeared to take our wine order and to apologize for the wait, explaining she was the only one working that night. We then waited and waited until the wine appeared, with a further explanation that, not only was she alone, but it was her first night on the job. A family came into the restaurant with a very small child and was offered the uncleared table. The child rebelled, stated firmly (and quite rightly) that he did not want to sit somewhere &#34;so messy.&#34; Service halted while the waitress--apparently also acting as the busboy--cleaned up. Eventually, our food order was taken and we waited some more. A woman near us wondered what it would take to order some wine. Time passed and the waitress came back and said that the &#34;machine&#34; was broken and she had been unable to place our order, what was it again? More time passed and the waitress brought out our dinner, but mine was not what I ordered. The waitress apologized and asked if I might want it anyway. No. [Note to waitress, when the &#34;machine&#34; is broken an alternative technology that might help is the &#34;pen and paper.&#34;] I thought another glass of wine might help, but realizing that ordering wine might take a rather long time, my husband went to fetch some from the (wine) bar area, where the waitress was--surprise--also the bar tender. Eventually, the food came: perhaps the teensiest portion of salmon I have ever seen. <br><br>I have been a few times to Vin Sur Vingt before. The food is indifferent and the prices are too, given the size of the portions. (And, I say this as a really small person who does not eat much.) The service has always been lousy. This is not because the staff is poor, but because the manager is not hiring enough staff to cope. What sort of manager sends a young person, on her first night on the job, out to act as receptionist, busboy, bartender, and waitress all on her own? <br><br>On the plus side, the rose is nice and poured generously and--I assume this is what is responsible for many of the positive reviews--it is bliss to have a restaurant, any restaurant, in this culinary desert on the upper far west side.

We had just checked into our apartment for an 8 day stay at the Hotel Beacon at 2.15pm on Saturday, Sept 25th and we were starving ( breakfast was a distant memory from 7am that morning in Niagara ). This cafe was right next door and I snaffled a copy of the lunch menu from a female server before we headed up to our suite. I showed the menu to my wife and her response was...let&#39;s do it ! So we scuttled back down in the elevator from the 21st floor and bumped into the hotel doorman at the hotel entrance. Our doorman friend said that this joint was just a diner but we told him we were starving and it was close. DONE DEAL ! We walked inside around 2.45pm and the same female server came by to take our lunch order. My wife ordered a Turkey Club ( bacon, lettuce, tomato..served with french fries, cole slaw &amp; pickle ) and I selected the Italiano Panini ( grilled chicken, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella &amp; pesto on thin panini...served with french fries ). We also asked for 2 x Lattes. Our lunch order arrived within a very short time and looked beyond sensational.....the biggest thickest paninis I&#39;ve ever seen (around $20 each ). Everything on our plates tasted fabulous....the French Fries were killer good ! Our Lattes arrived and didn&#39;t look so good and didn&#39;t taste so good. We complained to a server and the manager came over and said they are WET LATTES ( no frothy milk ) which is what New Yorkers prefer. I thought he was full of shit so we asked for CAPPUCCINOS. They eventually came out to our table and even though they looked better...tasted pretty average ! However our lunch sandwiches tasted AWESOME even though the size of the serves was beyond our ability to finish ! We came back the next evening and bought a couple of slices of different chocolate cakes for dessert later in our apartment. Not cheap at about $20 for the 2 slices and pretty average taste we thought. We are not diner fans and and this was the only place where we ran into the New York stereotypical model.

I find the location a bit odd but it was fun seeing this here of all places. The first time I ordered the jollof rice which I have had prior with oxtail as well as the plantains. The rice was very well flavored and while there wasn&#39;t a ton of oxtail, it was quite tasty. The rice made it a filling meal and overall it was fine for the price. Sure it&#39;s not the prices you&#39;ll find in Harlem but this is Midtown East so I&#39;m not exactly sure what you&#39;re expecting. I have noticed on their menu that they have added more dishes which I am happy to see. The plantains are not to my preference though this might be personal bias as I prefer sweet plantains over these though I also didn&#39;t like the texture much.<br><br>The next time, I was here with three others and we sat outside at one of the only setups. Again we got the jollof rice as well as the coconut fried rice, kenkey, beef suya, egusi with greens, shito, and the full fried snapper which used to be only on Saturdays I believe. They also gave us a free container of their peanut butter stew which was nice.<br><br>As before, the jollof was good. I found the coconut fried rice to be a bit bland by comparison even with all the ingredients but the texture was nice. The kenkey went with everything and I liked the fermented flavor. My preference was the beef suya which are kebabs cut into small pieces that almost look like sausages with a lot of spices as well as peanut powder. The dish was quite spicy and it packed a ton of flavor and if I was in the area more, I would definitely order again. The egusi with greens was unique. I knew egusi as melon seeds but I wasn&#39;t expecting the fish inside. The fish had a strong flavor and a texture almost reminding me of fish jerky and the dish had an interesting texture. I happened to get this one other time to see whether I really liked it and overall I like the fish but not the texture as much and I&#39;m happy to see that the current menu has multiple versions of this dish. The fried whole red snapper was excellent with a perfect fry. No complaints at all. Finally the free peanut butter stew had a nice flavor and it went quite well with the kenkey and especially to help flavor the coconut rice. The shito or black pepper sauce had an interesting texture and it was very well flavored also and not just heat.<br><br>Overall outside of the coconut rice and the plantains (and the egusi but it might just be an acquired taste,) everything here was very tasty. It&#39;s a pricey place but it is in Midtown East and the food is halal so it&#39;s a bit more expensive. The place is overall a nice change from the rest of the places in the area. I&#39;ll definitely go back for the suya at least if I&#39;m in the area.

I was so excited for this meal, especially since it had been a while since I had such easy access to kenkey, ugali, or jollof rice.

I liked the black pepper sauce you can get with your dishes, which had a lot of flavor and really packed a punch.

I kept my order simple with the complete American breakfast, getting two soft poached eggs, wheat toast, etc. I was amazed when the plate arrived, as I&#39;ve never seen poached eggs so delicately and perfectly prepared.

I had the Snapper Livornese. The presentation was a non starter. See my photos. Fortunately, I missed lunch today and was ravenous. With my 1st bite I was turned off. The dish was a filleted fish and it had scales!!! I pushed through and ate it. The fish was over cooked and seasoned as if the cook had poured a mixture of capers, olives and tomatoes mixed in Italian salad dressing over it. A messy salad \u00a0was thrown beside it on the plate. UGH! Oh! I forgot, we had an appetizer of Fried Calamari that we sent back after two bites. The taste was that of deep fried paper, no exaggeration. The waitress was gracious about it. My hubby had the $30 steak dish. He immediately said upon tasting it that it was sooo not a $30 steak, and that he could have paid half that price anywhere on Vernon Bvld and gotten a very decent steak. It was waaaay over cooked. He had to ASK the waitress to bring him a steak knife, steak sauce and ketchup and the salad which came with the dish. The waitress took her time bringing them. Side note: there was only one other party in the restaurant at the time. SMH! After a while,<br>the waitress comes over and asks my husband how it was was. He said &#34;I am trying hard to enjoy it.&#34; She volunteered that she would give us desserts on the house. This clearly was not her first time at the rodeo. We packed up the remaining steak so we could take home every thing we paid for -- even if we just wanted to give it to the neighbor&#39;s dog. \u00a0Then we asked for the check. Even though the check was ridiculously high for poor food, the waitress had included a $16.00 tip! \u00a0Of course we felt it was quite undeserved. We paid cash and tipped way less, which is very unusual for us but this was a bad experience. As we exited the restaurant, the waitress \u00a0has the gall to come over to us to tell us that the bill was missing the total amount requested. I told her that the food did not warrant the tip that she added onto our bill. Mind you, this adding of the tip was not mentioned on the menu at all. She proceeded to say that this is the way they ring things up at this restaurant, and if we did not add the tip that she included to our bill that she would have to cover it. &#34;That&#39;s why I gave you the free desserts&#34; she said. Awwww too bad, was my thought. But my Hubby is a softie, even on a stomach of meh service and bad steak.

So I did my research and read some good reviews about Vista Sky Lounge. Street parking was a bit of an issue. We read somewhere that the valet parking is only for private events. Well, we made sure we got there on time for our evening reservation. They do have a 20 minute grace period by the way. So if you are running late...you should give them a call to let them know. I had spoken to Regina (when I thought we would be late) and she was so helpful!<br><br>Once we got to the penthouse, the view of the city was AMAZING. Our reservation was for 7:30 pm and there was still light outside. We were waiting for it to get darker to truly take in the spectacular view.<br>Our table was ready and waiting for us. So there was no standing around waiting for an available seat. The host was polite and greeted us with a nice smile. The music was upbeat and a little loud (but not overwhelming) since there were three birthday parties going on at the same time. These parties had their own sections.<br><br>Now for the food and drinks. As for the appetizers...we had the lobster mac and cheese was was DELICIOUS. The calamari with marinara sauce was just ok. We should have asked for tartar sauce.<br>As for the entree...I had the Prime Tagliata NY Strip Steak with truffle fries. I had ordered the steak medium well and it was perfect. I have to get used to the truffle fries. It was just ok for me. Wifey got the Wild Scottish Salmon with the rice pilaf. She had LOVED the salmon, but did not like the rice pilaf. She felt that it didn&#39;t taste that fresh. She would not order the rice pilaf again. Next time she will ask them to switch it for something else.<br><br>Now the drinks..my wife made fun of me since her drink was stronger than my tropical fruity drink. The more and more I had tasted her drink..the more upset I got with myself lol. Hey..I love the color blue. So I chose the Ocean Blue drink that had coconut rum, blue curacao, cream of coconut &amp; pineapple juice \u00a0 (and can&#39;t forget the pineapple). Don&#39;t get me wrong..it was very tasty....but it&#39;s more suitable to drink this when you&#39;re laid out at the beach. Now wifey&#39;s drink was the strong Skyline that had whiskey, amaretto di Saronno, pineapple and oj (and can&#39;t forget the cherry).<br><br>A festive place like this...we would come back and basically order a bunch of appetizers, some drinks and take in the beautiful view.

The signature drink was decent enough that I&#39;d come back for maybe cocktails and to try something else<br><br>Popped in randomly for brunch. The interior is very nice but definitely on the pricier side.<br><br>The Twilight Fizz was interesting. A non-alcoholic concoction of espresso, orange juice, tonic. It was refreshing, coffee-ish and fruity all at the same time. As weird as it looked, I actually enjoyed this quite a bit.<br><br>Omelette rice. The creamy soft-scrambled egg you&#39;d expect that is in fashion now but not cut table side which was a bit of a shame. The demi-glace sauce was flavorful but a bit too sweet. The fried rice under had some bacon and mushrooms but again - the sauce was overpowering for me that I couldn&#39;t taste the individual flavor of the rice. Just the texture of the grains. Neither the bacon or mushrooms had much char on it so it just kind of got lost in the egg mush covered in sauce.<br><br>Ramen. This place does say &#34;Ramen Bar&#34; so I did need to try it. I understand that a shio ramen is mostly salt for seasoning and so it is not going to be quite as rich as a tonkotsu broth. It was clean tasting, the bamboo shoots were cooked well as was the chasiu. At right under $20, I felt like there are much better options for ramen out there at this price point. If you don&#39;t like rich broths though, you may enjoy this. It is definitely on the lighter side.<br><br>Creme Brulee Souffle Pancake. Not quite as fluffy as I was hoping for. A bit more eggy and dense, something reminiscent of a sponge cake maybe. The sauce was fine but not particularly interesting.<br><br>Chicken Karaage. This was probably the tastiest thing here but then again - it is skin-on fried wings. So unlike the boneless chicken chunks you&#39;d be expecting, think elevated Chinese takeout wings. I don&#39;t mean that as a diss, that&#39; s just the flavor that comes to mind. Imagine the your favorite takeout spot&#39;s wings but they just put a bit more TLC in it and tossed it in spice and fried garlic. <br><br>All in all - I had very high expectations for this place.

I have waited 20 years to find the perfect lemonade and Viand has it. I love a sour drink it was just perfect. I appreciated that the bagel came with the cream cheese on the side, it allows u to control how much or little. The berry sauce was also the perfect amount of sweet to add on top. The berry bowl was good, typical berries not much to say here. But the bowl they served them in was a very nice blue cracked glaze design and I enjoyed that.

Slow/bad service, potentially broken credit card machine, limited seating, doughy/soggy bland crepes.

Their credit card machine was down. Luckily, I had cash on me. Most of their other customers only had credit card and needed to run to the bank for cash. I ordered, paid the price difference, and sat down. When they started serving people who came after me I grew suspicious. I asked how much longer until my order would be done. Apparently, my order was never passed onto the person making the food! I was only the second customer in the place when I ordered. By the time I realized I had been forgotten, it was filling up with the after school rush. I didn&#39;t get an apology or anything. They just asked me what I ordered and eventually made it. I got my crepes to go because I was tired of waiting and done with the screaming children hopped up on sugar. <br><br>What I got:<br>-Savory crepe with Prosciutto, raclette cheese, and sliced potatoes: Very bland! Even the normally salty Prosciutto did not help to balance out the blandness of the cheese and potatoes. It desperately needed a flavorful sauce. <br>-Sweet crepe with Nutella: They packed in way too much Nutella. Toward the end I felt like I was drinking my crepe!<br><br>I was really disappointed overall with the actual crepes themselves. They were barely crispy on the edges. I think the batter was too thick and they were rushed. So the crepes as a result were extra thick and soggy. Not that delicious crisp with each bite. I wouldn&#39;t go back. There are better crepe places or if I&#39;m feeling really adventurous, I&#39;ll make my own crepes with extra butter!<br><br>***UPDATE: A kind Managing Director from this company reached out to me to help correct my bad first experience here and assure me that they would provide additional training.
