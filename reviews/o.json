This past weekend, I happened to find myself in the area and stopped into O&#39;Casey&#39;s for brunch. OMG is all I can say. I was absolutely shocked at how unexpectedly great the food was! It was *NOT* your typical underwhelming Irish Pub in a tourist trap food.. not at all. The food was AMAZING! <br><br>Everything made from scratch - even the bun on the hamburger! Hand cut fries, super fresh meat and toppings. My bf said it was one of the best burgers he&#39;s had! I went with the meatloaf and was very happy with my choice. Very fresh and tasty. Awesome mashed potatoes, gravy and fresh broccoli. Portion sizes were great too. I honestly still can&#39;t believe I found such a great meal at an Irish Pub in Times Square - it just doesn&#39;t make sense! <br><br>We went with the bottomless mimosas along with our brunch which also did not disappoint. They used good OJ and not too much of it, which is key! Prosecco is on tap which is rare but awesome. <br><br>Seriously though. I know, I know.. If you&#39;re a NY&#39;er, Times Square is the worst! BUT.. If you find yourself in this neck of the woods or if you&#39;re up for a challenge do check this place out. If you&#39;re a tourist who thrives in this area of the city, by all means have a meal or 2 here.

The waitress and the owner were the only people here. They did get a few construction people from next door in and a food delivery. Those people did hang around for a bit, but most people came for a pint and then left. They didn&#39;t really stick around for the time my friend and I were there.<br><br>I ordered a soda ($4) and my friend ordered a vodka and a club ($11). The soda was flat and had an artificial sweetness to it. It tasted like RC cola. The waitress mentioned that everything on the menu is made fresh. I sort of believed her until I saw a food delivery for chicken tenders. However, I think she must have meant the entrees.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t decide between the chicken sandwich ($17) or the pot pie ($22), so I got both. My friend got the bangers and mash ($21). They mentioned that the bangers tasted exactly like what her Irish grandmother used to make and that they tasted like real Irish sausages. The chicken sandwich was delicious and the meat was chicken breast that was roasted. The bread was a bit stale and fell apart easily, but the sandwich was good overall. I was surprised at how thick the french fries were though. These seemed more like wedges than fries to me. The pot pie was delicious and stuffed with bits of chicken. The gravy had a nice buttery taste. I ate most of the pot pie and took home the rest. Sadly, it didn&#39;t taste as great the next day. The food was delicious and hearty here.<br><br>They didn&#39;t have any desserts ready other than ice cream. The ice cream tasted rich and creamy but it wasn&#39;t homemade. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that it was filled with ice chips.<br><br>In the beginning, I mentioned that the construction workers and other people stopped by often. Well, they are the reasons why I rated this place so low. One worker came with his cooler and was chatting with the waitress. Then he went behind the bar and poured his own drink. Another worker walked in with his full construction clothes and was picking his nose the entire way. He went right into the kitchen area/bus area and made himself some tea or coffee and then took out the trash. The entire time, this man didn&#39;t wash his hands but was touching everything. He came in several times and went back and forth. The chef even came out to help with the food delivery and the same thing as the owner and right back they went into the kitchen to peel and prep. The kitchen is partially viewable but, they were going back and forth so often it \u00a0didn&#39;t seem like they washed their hands. Also, I do not like that they were letting people off the streets to go back of the bar, into the kitchen/prep area without cleaning their hands. The bathroom is another sore point of mine. The bathroom is clean but only one side of the faucet has a handle. The other was broken and unusable. Several people have used the bathroom before me, including the chef and the waitress (multiple times). We were sitting right in front of the bathroom. The sink was bone dry when I went to use it. No one stray droplet of water anywhere, not even on the sink. I tend to be careful but, I always get droplets. You might think, but maybe they used a towel to clean it up. Here \u00a0is the other thing, they had a hand dryer and it was broken. So, how would the sink be bone dry if they used it and how did everyone dry their hands? Everyone came out with dry hands and went back to work. My hands were soaking wet and my friend asked me why I didn&#39;t dry my hands. So, I am lead to believe that they knew the dryer was broken, so, they just didn&#39;t wash their hands. After realizing that and seeing people come in and out of the kitchen, I felt a bit queasy. Thankfully, I felt alright, but it still didn&#39;t make me feel better.<br><br>I will say the service and the food were great. I would visit again just for the home-cooked food, but the cleanliness is what&#39;s preventing me from coming back.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 2}, {"photoCount": 4, "reviewCount": 20, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "9/10/2023", "comment": {"text": "As a New Yorker as much as it is expensive to live here , we all try to get a bargain some time.

There&#39;s an open kitchen and tvs if you&#39;re into watching while eating. I didn&#39;t venture upstairs, but I&#39;m assuming there&#39;s more seating. Tabitha the bartender was lovely. Happy to make recommendations. I ordered a blue point toasted draft and the caramelized onion flatbread. I didn&#39;t read carefully when ordering so I was a little surprised by the dominant saltiness of the anchovies and olives, but it was good once i switched gears from sweet to savory. I&#39;d get the prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula and hot honey version next time. It was quiet in the restaurant, and just right for my mood today.

Because this restaurant is in a high-volume area of Edgewater, we were happy to see that they validate garage parking for customers. <br><br>We arrived at the designated garage listed on our reservation. As someone who has had plenty of experience garage parking in different cities, this was one of the worst garages I have ever seen. The floors were extremely confusing and did not go in numerical order. The flow of traffic in the garage was different on each floor. There was also a ridiculous amount of construction within the garage, making it even more confusing to get from floor to floor. <br><br>Once we had finally parked and made it out of that insane garage, we were excited to eat. We arrived in time for our reservation, but we waited a few minutes while our table was set. I had to use the restroom as we were waiting; it was pretty gross and unkempt. I expected better for a place like this. <br><br>As soon as we were seated, we took a few minutes to look at the menu. They charge a flat fee for KBBQ, but you still get to choose your selection of meats, appetizers, and sides. We went for a few Veggie Dumpling and Tteokkbokki orders. We chose a selection of about 3 different cuts of beef, 1 type of chicken, and some veggie orders. <br><br>Although we were initially being taken care of by one server, it seemed like a team effort. Different servers would bring items to our table. On each table they have a selection of sauces and small Banchan appetizers to eat with your meal. They also bring over bowls of steamed rice to eat with the meat.<br><br>Once our meats were brought over, they got the grill started. This KBBQ place is somewhere between others in terms of cooking meat. They seem to be pretty set on getting your meats started and checking in them as they cook. However, you&#39;re still allowed to move items on and off the grill to your liking.

I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the appetizers. I&#39;m someone who has had a lot of Korean food, and I didn&#39;t find any of them taste very good. The Veggie Dumplings were bland, and the Tteokkbokki had a strange texture compared to others I&#39;ve had. The meats were decent, but almost all of the dipping sauces had a very strange aftertaste. The service throughout was OK. The employees were diligent about checking on the meat and cooking process. However, I didn&#39;t find that any of them were particularly friendly or paid attention to customer service.<br><br>Overall, this place was OK. KBBQ is always a pretty fun experience.

The meat winners of the night were the pork belly, which was thick and not mostly fat like some bbq places, and the pork jowl, which was buttery and tender.

It was a busy night, but more attentive service would&#39;ve been appreciated. The bottom of our grill was burnt halfway through and while most places swap it out proactively, we had to call over our waiter to change it out.

It has charming touches like intricate light fixtures on each table. It&#39;s a narrow restaurant, which gives it an intimate effect. <br><br>We started off with the bruschette. I enjoyed it. It was $14 for 2 pieces and each had a different sauce (one tartufa and the other sundried tomatoes). <br><br>My friend had the Tagliolino Cacio &amp; Pepe ($27). I thought the sauce was creamy and quite good, but I was also not in love with it for some reason. <br><br>I had the filet mignon with the potatoes and I was not really into it... maybe I was not feeling the wine reduction.

I tasted it the most in the complimentary bread.<br><br>In terms of service, they are very sweet and kind so I feel bad but it&#39;s possible they just need more support like maybe another bus boy or a separate host etc. I felt like the host was also the waitress for the entire restaurant. <br><br>We were seated at 7:40 pm and we received bruschette 30 minutes later.

We had 7:30pm reservations on a Tuesday night. It was an unbearably hot night in NYC, so I called ahead earlier that day to make sure we could get a table of 4 for inside. They said no problem and that they made the note.<br><br>I arrived first at 6:25, and the host said I couldn&#39;t sit down until my entire party was here. Annoying, but a lot of restaurants in NY do that, so I understood. The rest of my group trickled in over the next 5 minutes, and we were ready to go at 7:35. The host said that there were no available tables (even though the entire back of the restaurant was empty), but there was one finishing up. He asked if we wouldn&#39;t mind waiting 10 minutes at the bar. We ordered a round of martinis and margaritas while we waited, and the bartender took FOREVER to make the drinks. We asked for 3 dirty martinis and 1 margarita, and he gave us 4 martinis instead....after almost 20 min.<br><br>Once we finally got our drinks, it was nearly 8:00...30 min past our reservation time.

My friend went up to him and asked why we hadn&#39;t been seated after 30 min, and he sat us right away. No apology.<br><br>Then, by the time we sat down, we were ready for another round.

Our waitress was hardly present, and she forgot to put the truffle pizza in.

Definitely on the pricey side, but pretty worth it IMO.<br><br>I went here on a Tuesday evening while visiting NY on a business trip. It was at about 7:30pm and I was by myself, but I selected this restaurant after reading the many positive reviews on Yelp. I saw the burger, read about the burger, and decided that the burger was to be mine. I walked into the festively-decorated (spooky) restaurant and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. She asked me where I&#39;d like to sit: front, bar, or back. I elected for the back and was brought to a table that could sit for. There were a decent number of diners already there (many of which spoke French), but there were also some tables open.<br><br>Soon, I was introduced to my server for the evening, Nizar. He asked me if I wanted tap or sparkling water and supplied me with the drink and food menus. To note, the food menu doesn&#39;t align exactly with the online version (for ingredients and prices), but they are mostly the same. Nizar gave me a few minutes to look over the menu and then returned. I then ordered.<br><br>Diet Coke - Yes, I put it here. The reason why is because they serve little 8 oz glass bottles for $4 each. Be aware :-)<br><br>The Burger - This creation combines so many amazing ingredients together in such an artfully crafted way as to only be described as quite masterful. \u00a0I ordered mine prepared medium and it was super juicy, fresh, flavorful (especially with the supplement of chipotle sauce), and was pretty filling. The burger also came with a nice side salad and a basket of steak-cut fries with ketchup, both of which were quite enjoyable. \u00a0That burger, though...that&#39;s a solid burger.<br><br>After eating both of these items, I decided to use my Yelp Check-in offer to get a cappuccino, and then ordered macarons to go. \u00a0The cappuccino was nice and frothy. Back at the hotel room I discovered that he macarons were amazing. Great flavors and textures. Even flavors that I don&#39;t normally enjoy were really REALLY good.<br><br>Throughout the whole meal, Nizar was friendly and attentive.

Our server, Nore, was fantastic - he was courteous, always checked in at the right time, and every recommendation he made was spot on.<br><br>Shortly after being seated, we were given a basket of warm breads with whipped butter. The breads were enjoyable, and we had to tell ourselves not to eat too much of it so we didn&#39;t get full before we got to our food. For apps, we had the Beet Salad and Jumbo Lump Crab Cake. Both were delicious and a nice warm-up for our respective main courses of Blackened Snapper &amp; Chilean Sea Bass. Both fishes were flavorful without being over-seasoned. They were cooked to perfection and had no unpleasant fishiness. While neither portion was huge, they were satisfying, especially in concert with sides of Jalapeno Au Gratin and Asparagus w. Hollandaise. The potatoes may have been one of my favorite &#34;simple&#34; sides I&#39;ve had in recent memory at a comparable restaurant - they were nothing fancy but well executed and with just the right punch of flavor and not too dense/heavy. <br><br>While we were satisfied after our meal, we opted for dessert anyway and ordered the Chocolate Torte.

The place has a white interior that provides the feel of a laid-back San Francisco seafood restaurant. We all had the Tasting Menu. <br><br>Pro tip: Unless you&#39;re not very hungry and only want a single dish, I highly recommend the 4 course Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu for $95. It&#39;s a great deal because, unlike other tasting menus, you actually get to select from the regular menu 1 appetizer, 1 pasta, 1 main dish, and 1 dessert. It becomes an even better deal if you select higher priced options.<br><br>I arrived a little earlier than my friends and decided to order a Smokey Old Fashioned, which was rebuffed by &#34;No&#34; from the bartender. To which I responded, &#34;Just an old fashioned?&#34;. The bartender said, &#34;Much better.&#34; This drink was such a heavy pour that it was strong enough to last me through the dessert.<br><br>For the appetizer, I chose the Yellowtail Crudo, while some of my friends opted for the Tuna Tartare. I would say that Tuna was the winner here since flavors of acidity and saltiness complemented the Tuna better than the poppy seeds and spicy sauce did for the Yellowtail. But that&#39;s nitpicking, as both options were superb.<br><br>For the pasta, everyone went with this establishment&#39;s staple, the Lobster Scampi. Perfectly cooked pasta, layered with delectable pink cream sauce with hints of basil throughout, bombarded with generous chunks of buttery lobster. I usually avoid pasta dishes at an establishment of this caliber. But this was a satisfying pasta dish without making me feel heavy or bloated.<br><br>For the main course, I went rogue and ordered the Seared Scallops, one ordered the branzino, and most went for the Halibut. There&#39;s a reason why Halibut is a favorite of most visitors here - it is perfectly prepared with a flavor profile that is truly enjoyable. The Branzino was ok, but not really outstanding in any aspect. The Seared Scallops were delicious and had an excellent complement with hash browns, sauce, caviar, and greens. It truly had an amazing combination that created an enjoyable taste. It would have been the clear winner had the portion not been so small. In Spanish, cuisine terms, it was closer to a pintxos portion than a tapas portion. A main dish with only two scallops is laughable.<br><br>For the dessert, I chose the Pistachio Semifreddo, while my friends went for the Chocolate Cake and Lemon Cheesecake. Pistachio Semifreddo had a very good flavor with that nutty undertone throughout and a crumble base. Overall, it was a good unremarkable dessert. The lemon cheesecake was memorable, with citrus flavor throughout the dense sweetness of the cheesy goodness. The chocolate cake is a star here, as it pairs the rich chocolate cake layer with dark chocolate coating, contrasted by several fresh berries.<br><br>A thoroughly enjoyable experience.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 3695, "reviewCount": 989, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "10/11/2023", "comment": {"text": "Came for a late lunch with a former business associate.

I was dumbfounded that the person who brought the oysters out didn&#39;t take a moment to tell us which were which; and I was even more dumbfounded when we flagged our waiter over to ask him and he told us that he would have no idea and we should have asked the guy who brought them out.

These are my favs: the three diff kinds were eggplant, spinach, and leek and tbh I wasn&#39;t sure which one was which but at the end of the day I liked them all so I guess it doesn&#39;t matter?!<br><br>TSITSILA RACHULAD: Cornish hen with blackberry+cilantro+garlic sauce. We got this because it sounded interesting. It was pretty much exactly as described but for some reason I was not expecting it the Cornish hen to be chopped up so small - it felt like every single piece was 80% bone, 10% sauce, 10% meat. It was a very high-effort endeavor to eat this and at the end of the meal I just had a plate piled high with bones and chicken parts that I couldn&#39;t fully disentangle (and I feel like every piece I got was a drumstick? .... does that mean I ate like 5 hens ?!?). The sauce had an interesting, rich flavor but couldn&#39;t quite taste the blackberry. <br><br>Next time, I could see myself ordering the Pkhali Trio, maybe the Khinkali and the Borscht again, but probably not the Tsitsila Rachulad.

Odo immediately transported me back to Tokyo with its decor and ambiance, which made me reminisce about the wonderful fine dining experiences from a recent trip. The atmosphere is very zen-like with the kitchen working harmoniously in virtual silence.<br><br>Our menu included the following: <br><br>Asparagus (asparagus foam, golden caviar, vinegar jelly), soup (shima aji, lotus root tofu, baby lotus root, scallion, yuzu, junsai), Long Island duck (Australian black truffle, sansho pepper, lotus root), mini chirashi (chutoro, tai, ikura, kinmedai), house-made soba (Kumamoto wagyu, kaireki, micro shiso), and a dessert of milk flavored soft serve with amaou strawberry.<br><br>Unfortunately, there was no written menu so I&#39;m recollecting the menu items from the best of my abilities from the descriptions of the wait staff. I would rate the food as near immaculate with both the aesthetic presentation and the taste.<br><br>The lunch service started off strong with a wonderful asparagus dish with accompanying asparagus foam, golden caviar (I&#39;m assuming kaluga given the price point of the meal), vinegar jelly, and shiso flower blossom. This dish was a perfect representation of the transition from spring to summer with the cool foam and acidic vinegar jelly providing both a refreshing and bright bite when shuffled with the luxurious pearls of golden caviar. I would definitely say that this dish and the soba noodles were the highlights of my meal here.<br><br>The soup course prominently featured lotus root both in tofu form and sliced form. The shima aji was tender and succulent as it was immersed in the base of the soup. The soup itself was subtly flavored and allowed the lotus root tofu to be the focus of the dish. The yakimono course featured Long Island duck with the optional supplement of Australian black truffle. The duck itself was succulent and simply prepared while having a slight heat from the sansho peppercorn while being paired beautifully with the shaved black truffle which gave off its typical earthy aroma. The mini chirashi course was cute, with three pieces of sashimi from 3 types of fish (bluefin tuna, tai, kinmedai) with ikura on top. All of the proteins were expertly prepared and sliced, providing a small taste of each while not imposing a large volume of food as a standalone course.<br><br>The star of the show was the house-made soba noodles. This soba had the perfect bite; it was not gummy and had the proper density, bounciness, and thickness. The rare slices of Kumamoto wagyu served as a wonderful accoutrement to the noodles as the textures of both melded very well together due to their relative thinness. The herbal notes from the micro shiso and other vibrant green herbs added a refreshing vegetal component to the shoyu based broth and buckwheat from the soba.<br><br>The dessert was definitely not an afterthought, albeit it was a bit melted by the time it got presented to us. The texture of the soft serve was velvety smooth with a pronounced milk flavor. The amaou strawberry was treated with just enough sugar to serve as a perfect pairing to this soft serve ice cream. \u00a0<br><br>This was a wonderful meal that I&#39;ll soon not forget.

We added truffles to the A3 wagyu and they did not hold back. It was like eating truffles with a side of meat. It was our first time having raw egg yolk &amp; soy sauce with meat and we loved the combination. The quality of the A4 wagyu was amazing and it melted in your mouth. The dessert of ice cream with a watermelon sauce was fantastic and nothing like we had eaten before. We were thinking about this meal days after. <br><br>I do wish the ambiance was a little better. It was so quiet that we sometimes felt uncomfortable speaking above hushed voices, maybe some background music could help.

Restaurants in New York City are in general more expensive than most cities around the world, and knowing Jun is a wonderful cook at home I no longer felt obliged to check out every single new restaurant in the city. In other words, we wanted to make sure we visit places that are actually worth the money. That value factor becomes even more acute at expensive tasting menu restaurants; while Per Se is a very good restaurant, it was not wonderful enough to justify over $350 per person before drinks. Other times, we felt so lucky to indulge on the meal at Atomix for slightly over $200 per person. I&#39;ve been meaning to check out Odo for a while with all the wonderful reviews coming from the press; the key question was going to be whether the $200 per person price tag for the restaurant&#39;s kaiseki menu was going to be worth it. We did have a good meal at Odo, but concluded that the value proposition was a bit shaky.<br><br>The kaiseki menu at Odo consists of a few starters followed by a series of sushi nigiris, then a few more savory courses and a seasonal cocktail and dessert combination. While we both appreciated the creativity behind each dish, we also felt short of marveling at how delicious it was. The use of caviar and cacao nibs on top of black sesame tofu in the first sakizuke course, for instance, was quite smart but the flavor of caviar and cacao nibs didn&#39;t quite gel together. While the bluefin toro in the owan dish was well-cooked, Jun found the broth to be slightly fishy. We both loved the gindara misozuke using sablefish from Canada, but wondered if the dish would&#39;ve been even better with the truffle on top that somewhat overpowered the fish&#39;s flavor. Compared to the first few starter courses, the sushi course at Odo was quite consistently good. During the sushi course, chef Seong Cheol Byun came in front of our counter and started expertly preparing each nigiri. To my surprise, he noted that the vast majority of sushi at Odo is not sourced from Japan but from fishermen in NYC&#39;s vicinity like Montauk with personal connections to chef Hiroki Odo. Moreover, he said, the rice during our course was sourced from a noted rice master in Japan. Whether it&#39;s from the freshness of the ingredients or the optimal firmness of rice, most of the pieces we tried were actually quite good, from the very chewy pollock and tile fish (both from Long Island) to the Florida jack fish to blowtorched New Jersey bonito with radish on top. If Mr. Byun wants to open his own sushi shop one way, I have no doubt he will do very well. Following the wonderful sequence of sushi nigiris, the last two savory courses were also good but not particularly memorable. The takiwase dish with washugyu, tofu shabu shabu and burdock had aromatic flavor overall, but Jun and I had had better quality meats elsewhere. For the gohan course, Jun got the shrimp tempura soba while I got the king crab ramen. I tried both and didn&#39;t come away with lasting impression; the broth of the ramen didn&#39;t have the depth I would usually savor from a tonkotsu bowl, and the soba noodle&#39;s texture was strangely not very firm. For the dessert course, our server brought out a seasonal cocktail menu made with shochu and sparkling wine in front of the diners. It was a refreshing drink, but we were slightly puzzled why the kitchen only brought out a slice of dates monaka with sake kasu ice cream inside. We would&#39;ve expected something a little bit more elaborate for a $200 per person meal.<br><br>Getting a reservation at Odo wasn&#39;t too difficult although the counter was more often than not full with diners coming in and out. The minimalistic dining room was perhaps too much quiet, giving an eerie vibe to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. We shared a bottle of dry sake to complement the meal and there are also expensive wine bottles available. The service was also somewhat off; not that we care about a server bowing to us in 90 degrees at the end of the meal to express gratitude (which is fairly typical in Japanese restaurants that deeply value hospitality), but Jun couldn&#39;t help but notice that our server bowed in front of an American diner sitting next to me while not doing so to us. In any event, while Odo was overall a good restaurant, especially in the sushi course where I would love to come back for, we both felt a bit sad having shelled out a lot of money at the place. Is this a new norm for expensive Japanese sushi and kaiseki restaurants in the city? Perhaps our taste and expectation are a little bit more stringent when it comes to Asian food, but the visit to Odo really made me think about giving the value component of a restaurant more weight in our culinary journey.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 213, "reviewCount": 1843, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "2/15/2020", "comment": {"text": "You won&#39;t find a streetfront sign or window for Odo at all; instead, it&#39;s nestled through a hallway behind Hall, the speakeasy-like lounge that is on the street (and has no signage either). Without any natural light or being close to the street, you do feel like you have been transported away for an intimate dining experience once you have made your way back. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the reservation system here; you can select a given time to sit down, but we waited almost 15 minutes in Hall before being escorted back to take our seat, and then we had to wait until everyone in our half of the counter seating (which was 6 of us) was present before the meal could start. It&#39;d be much easier (and have less dead time) if they simply did 4 nightly seatings (with 2 staggered by 15-30 minutes from the other), as that is effectively what happens. Once seated, though, the meal is very well-paced, and given the front-row seat to the kitchen, you can see a lot of the preparation in action. I would also give props to the gentleman who was in charge of the drink advice and served some of the dishes - he knew his stuff inside and out and was very helpful in giving me advice on which sake to try. The drink menu is fairly limited - unlike Hall, there are no cocktails (except as part of the tasting menu) or beer selections, just sake and wine - but given the delicate nature of the food served here, there is no need to have other types of alcohol listed.<br><br>The food here is presented as a kaiseki tasting menu covering 8 courses, with one of the courses being an 8-piece sushi omakase tasting within the meal. Because of the natural setup of the space, the sushi was served from a bit of a mobile / compact kit, with all the fish pre-sliced (which did lend itself to it not coming off as fresh as it could have been). Overall, I found the sushi to be decent, if not the best selection of fish you would ordinarily find. The rest of the meal was pretty good as well, with the highlights being the starting bite (uni and caviar served over a cauliflower puree - a nice mix of creamy decadence with a heartier base), as well as the grilled sablefish, which had a very nice peanut curry glaze that is a hint of more of a southeast Asian flavor, but a bit more subtle. The fish was also cooked to a perfect buttery texture. The choice of the &#39;gohan&#39; - a truffled ramen with egg in it - was a nice, warm finish to the savory courses, although it did tend a little towards the salty side. That said, I did find the dessert (an ice cream sandwich) to be somewhat simple, and the beef dish - cooked with wagyu cross-bred with Angus - to be served in a flavorful broth, but the beef itself was either a chewier cut or simply not cooked enough.<br><br>On balance, the food at Odo is well-executed on balance, and the setting provides for a very cozy dining experience.

A few days ago I stopped back in to say hello for old time&#39;s sake. An unnecessarily intimidating security guy recognized me and turned me away, quite rudely in fact. 8 years later. Mind boggling. Not just the unforgiving part, but the way it was handled and how I was treated in the process. It&#39;s very sad.
