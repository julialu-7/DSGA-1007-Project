Ordering: the guy at the reugister didn&#39;t take a name, said the wait was 10-15 minutes, which is standard for 7th st burger everywhere. We grabbed our sodas from fridge and then found a spot and waited.... And waited... and waited... until we, as well as 2 other tables of patrons who ordered before us but hadn&#39;t gotten food either noticed: the food was coming out from the back in white paper bags and being neatly lined up by the window/counter behind the staff at the register, but he wasn&#39;t turning around to check at all, and - didn&#39;t seem to care? Thus he wasn&#39;t calling out any orders when they were ready- but then again- he&#39;s not taking names down, so who is he going to call? Everyone eventually got food. Saw that one of the tables got their bag of food but then moments later saw the guy from the register come up w a diff bag and ask them to swap because he&#39;d given them the wrong order. If you&#39;re familiar w 7th street burger hospitality, then you&#39;re also aware that their staff are usually great at remembering who ordered what and never mix things up. Now the food: this is quite possibly the greasiest I&#39;ve ever seen a 7th street burger. The wrappers were literally dripping oil? Definitely had to dab away at it with multiple napkins like we normally for for a pizza slice. The burger patty was more burnt than other locations. Onions, pickles, and sauce was great.

While the prices were higher, I liked supporting local business. However, over the past year or so, the selection has truly gone down hill, as has the staff. We bought a package of cookies, only to get home and find someone had already opened it and taken out over half of the cookies. We brought them back immediately, and were told it was a frequent problem they were having. If this was a one off, I could ignore it, but it felt like EVERY time we went there, one of the items would be bad or damaged. <br><br>To make matters worse, the staff started getting really rude. The cashier commented to my husband once that he shouldn&#39;t let me by cookies and ice-cream if he wanted me to stay looking fit. Sadly, this type of comment was almost a REGULAR occurrence. I understand if the cashier was trying to be cute or make a joke, but it is totally inappropriate to make this type of comment to ANYONE. I am a fairly fit and trim woman, so I didn&#39;t let the comments get to me, but I couldn&#39;t believe that this was a type of harassing culture that was promoted and perpetuated! Disgusting!<br><br>The final straw came a few months ago, when I went in to grab something quickly. At the checkout, the line was a giant cluster****. There was a long line.

I got there, put my items on the counter, and he rang me up, I said &#34;one second, I&#39;m grabbing gum&#34; as I handed the cashier a $10 bill and reached to grab a pack that was right below the register. The cashier put my purchases aside, and took the man behind me with his two six packs of beer, and told me to go to the end of the line until I was ready. I got pissed and told him he had my cash in his hand, and all i was doing was adding a pack of gum. The \u00a0cashier then proceeded to chastise me for wasting his time, and the time of the paying customers behind me. Again, to be clear, this was because i reached to ADD a pack of gum. <br><br>In short, I have not been back. I will never go back. And if you are a wise individual, you shouldn&#39;t go here either.

Each year we visit my husband&#39;s brother who keeps kosher and each year we get screwed. (Past restaurants that are abominations include Ben&#39;s Kosher Deli - worst knish ever, and Mr. Broadway - please no.)<br><br>But then this year my husband had the great idea to eat at the Google caf\u00e9. He works at the Mountain View Google headquarters, but that nice badge can get us into New York Google for free eats. Plus, we read online that they carry glatt kosher food. Score.<br><br>5 Boroughs Caf\u00e9 is MUCH smaller than Hemispheres (the other Google caf\u00e9 in the New York Google office) and has a smaller selection of food. Unfortunately 5 Boroughs is the only one that&#39;s open for dinner. It took us awhile to find the glatt kosher stuff, but when I did I excitedly ran back to our table to tell my brother in law who had started noshing on salad. They carry packaged meals from Abigael&#39;s, which is an expensive, well-reviewed glatt kosher restaurant. The Abigael&#39;s meals included a prime rib sandwich and an entire tray of cookies. There was a sign saying to not eat the Abigael&#39;s offerings unless you were actually keeping kosher. (Until I saw that I was tempted to take some.)<br><br>But enough about the food 5 Boroughs doesn&#39;t make in-house.

It&#39;s the type of meal you order every once in a while, knowing full well that you&#39;re going to be tasting that shit all day and breathing it all over co-workers in meetings. It arrived quickly, but my wrap was not filled with the mystery chunks of chicken and buffalo sauce I had been craving, it was filled with what looked like a turkey cold cut. Meh, honest mistake. Maybe I&#39;ll just eat it, it&#39;s prob good, I thought. Nah, I really want to taste that gross-ass buffalo chicken, I decided. And so I called to let them know there was a mistake and to ask if they could bring me the right one, no rush. <br><br>That&#39;s when this relationship took a turn. They insisted that I should have known to scroll further down to the wrap section and that by clicking on it in the sandwich section, I would get a buffalo chicken cold cut (who on this planet knows that monstrosity of a cold cut even exists?). I accepted defeat, especially since it was being handed to me with such &#34;Absolutely no way we made a mistake&#34; certainty. <br><br>Still craving that disgusting ass lingering taste in exchange for immediate satisfaction, I took another look at the Seamless menu. Nope, no where did it say that all items in the Classic Sandwich section are all cold cuts, in fact, there&#39;s actually a sandwich or two in addition to the Buffalo Sandwich that are not cold cuts. Unless there&#39;s a Chicken Cutlet cold cut (buyer beware).<br><br>I called back and this time reminded them that several of their wraps and sandwiches are not even listed on their Seamless menu. I let them know I order from them almost daily. They said they know. They know who I am. (Great!) They continued to get angry, refuse to acknowledge that their menu could be confusing and they also let me know that they can read English. Conversation over. <br><br>I called Seamless. They took a look at the menu. Agreed it was confusing. Agreed that the assumption that a person who orders a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is expecting some Boars Head science project of a cold cut is absurd. Refunded my money.

The food looks fresh and plentiful, offering up lamb or chicken, and 3 types of rice: brown, yellow, and spicy. Two enthusiastic men and a kid were operating the cart at the time I visited this cart.<br><br>The grill was piled high with meat, divided into 3 sections with makeshift metal partitions. The very left contained the new food being grilled, followed by the chicken section being kept warm, and then the smallest of the three being the lamb meat which was being kept warm on the grill. Usually, I question how long the meat is sitting on the grill if I don&#39;t see them throw it on upon order. But because of the crowds and curiosity, I decided to order a Chicken over Rice ($5.00) with their spicy rice.<br><br>A styrofoam tray was immediately pulled out, piled with several spoonfuls of their spicy rice, salad, chicken, french fries, 1 falafel, and white sauce and hot sauce swirled on top in a spiral fashion for good measure. They are definitely quick, without a doubt. I was excited to see them throw fries and a falafel into my platter, one that I&#39;ve been longing ever since the generous chef Omar left the Little Morocco halal cart (the owner has decided not to honor Omar&#39;s generosity to his clientele, and stick to just the basics: rice, meat, and an overabundance of salad).<br><br>Portions are decent, the biggest highlight being that the salad, consisting of just chopped fresh lettuce, only took up 1/4 of the platter, as opposed to the 1/3 salad portions that many halal carts have recently been leaning towards to. The salad was crisp without any sign of browning, signifying freshness. Then came the rice, which was not very spicy, but had a subtle seasoning to it that didn&#39;t overpower the palate but enough to make a presence. The chicken was delightful, seasoned well and tender, and mixed with vegetables (onions, broccoli, etc.). The unseasoned fries were soggy, but were a nice touch to added some extra carbs to the dish. \u00a0The falafel was tolerable, although dry due to it being previously deep-fried and just sitting in a tray on the cart, but it had a good spice to it. The white sauce was your standard mayo-based sauce, and the hot sauce had a hint of spiciness but nothing overbearing.<br><br>On my second visit, I ordered the Lamb over Yellow Rice ($5.00). The lamb is by far much better. The lamb is thinly shaved off the doner kebab after it develops a very nice sear on one side, making for a subtly crispy outside, yet still maintaining a moistness inside. The yellow rice is moist yet not overly wet, making for a standard yellow rice. So far, I prefer the spicy rice, but have yet to try their white rice which actually has a yellow hue, as if it were cooked with chicken broth.<br><br>Overall, it made up for a fairly good halal cart, especially with the recent drought of good carts in the Westside (Garment District/34th St.) area. Little Morocco is no more, Adham&#39;s Halal Cart no longer provides the quality that it once did, the two gentlemen on 34th St/7th Ave. providing a heavily cardamom-spiced rice have been replaced by two new gentlemen, leaving it open to whoever wants to take over that market. These guys on 31st and Broadway definitely provide one of the better halal carts in the area and you will definitely find me coming back again. And free fries and falafels included?!

I love trying new Shanghai restaurants since I grew up eating Shanghai dishes. This restaurant has a $15 credit/debit card minimum, and they also charge a credit card transaction fee. <br><br>Food: I ordered the Shanghai wonton soup and crab and pork soup dumplings. I honestly would&#39;ve just ordered the wonton soup if I had cash on me, but I decided to get an order of soup dumplings to hit the minimum credit card amount. I found the filling in the wontons to be pretty dense, which I was not the biggest fan of. I&#39;ve never had a wonton that had a sense, chewy, and hard meat filling like these did. I still ate it since the flavor wasn&#39;t bad, but something about the texture was off. I liked how the soup came with seaweed, and it was seasoned well but I still added some chili oil to add some spice to the dish. The crab and soup dumplings were also good enough to eat, but not the best. My soup dumplings arrived as they were starting to cool down, so there wasn&#39;t much of a soupy broth. I tried to eat the soup dumplings first before they got cold, but by the end, they still got cold. I also would&#39;ve liked a stronger crab flavor.

Late last year, chef Kazuo jumped ship to a multi-restaurant concept called Juku in Chinatown, which consists of an izakaya on the ground floor and his omakase counter on the second floor. I have been meaning to check out Juku ever since the news of its opening to say hello to chef Kazuo (Jun was hoping that he would remember playfully showing us his own miniature figure at 1 or 8) and see if he was still killing it at the new location. We finally made it on a recent Friday evening. The transition from a cozy counter at a neighborhood Williamsburg restaurant to a counter inside a rather splashy modern Japanese space was noticeable, and it was evident that the audience at chef Kazuo&#39;s new counter was not the Brooklynites living near 1 or 8, but hip, young crowds with financial means to splurge for a sushi omakase dinner. Granted, the pricing (at $80 per person for 12 pieces and $120 per person for 15 pieces) still feels like a bargain compared to the hyper-expensive places that have recently opened in the city, but the charm of a neighborhood gem was no longer there. Well, what about the food? Compared to our experience at 1 or 8, we (especially Jun) felt the individual pieces were somewhat uneven in terms of quality of fish and the use of seasoning, but we nevertheless had a pretty satisfying meal.<br><br>One thing that Jun and I both noticed upon being served the first couple of nigiri pieces was that the size of each fish seemed to have become smaller than what we had at 1 or 8. Maybe all the costs into building the restaurant&#39;s glitzy space affected the &#34;downsizing&#34; of the fish size? And Jun immediately reacted negatively to the striped jack (shima aji) and soy marinated tuna that came as first and second pieces, remarking that the fish in both instances simply were not fresh enough (she senses the freshness of fish a lot better than I do). Other times, the use of seasoning was a bit of an issue. The fatty tuna (o toro) had superb, oily texture, yet it didn&#39;t need the extra salt on top of it. Chef Kazuo brought in some interesting pieces that we had not previously seen at other sushi restaurants, like a maki of baby sardines, but I felt it overused the soy sauce to give a rather funky flavor to the fish. Having mentioned all of these issues, I still felt the majority of pieces we sampled were wonderful, whether it was the golden eye snapper or Tasmanian king salmon that had silky smooth texture just the way I liked, or the Spanish mackerel with ghost pepper sea salt that had a very nice spicy kick, or the sea eel and the Hokkaido sea urchin (uni) that were literally melting in my mouth. Chef Kazuo also brought some interesting ingredients to the mix, such as Dungeness crab and the above mentioned baby sardines (although I have to confess neither was my favorite piece of the night), while also adding different types of flavor to give something extra to the fish, like the spicy scallion and the combination of lemon juice and sea salt that helped enhance the already delicious bonito and scallop respectively, or the yuzu flavor that worked beautifully with the Japanese grouper that displayed a surprisingly robust texture. A hand roll of fatty tuna, daikon radish and salmon roe was more or less a perfect ending to the meal that Jun and I also enjoyed a lot.<br><br>Getting a reservation at chef Kazuo&#39;s counter seating (which can hold 12 guests at each of the three settings a night at 6, 8 and 10 p.m.) is likely to require an advance reservation through Yelp. There is a full bar (in addition to sake and wine options, you can also order cocktails from the izakaya space downstairs), but a carafe of sake is probably the way to go here. As mentioned above, if you are looking for a dinner in a hip setting with the latest Pop music coming out from the speaker somewhere, Juku can provide that experience. If you want a bit more low key setting, you might actually get distracted during your meal. When Jun showed chef Kazuo the photo of his miniature figure that he showed us two years ago (coincidentally, we visited Juku exactly two years after we went to 1 or 8), he chuckled and said the little one is on vacation. This is one restaurant where Jun and I debated for a bit which KenScale score should be given. I gave credit to all the positives from the meal, while Jun said it was hard to overlook some of the inconsistencies that she did not see at 1 or 8. In any event, compared to the other much pricier options in the city, Juku does option a nice value proposition, and I do think chef Kazuo has not yet lost his touch entirely despite some of the misses.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 2, "reviewCount": 35, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "1/30/2018", "comment": {"text": "I dined at Juku two weeks ago, and to date, I still have only regret from visiting this restaurant for my friend&#39;s birthday.

My favorite, the beef, egg, and tomato on rice, is, in my opinion, still the best of its kind in Chinatown. Their &#34;Beijing-style&#34; fried pork chops and salt and pepper crispy squid are also quite good. Even the &#34;Western-style takeout&#34; dishes, such as the iconic General Tso&#39;s chicken, are well executed. <br><br>The waiters also do not forget a face. While I am pretty much a regular, eating with family friends here several times a year, I once came in with a friend originally from Toronto who had only been to their restaurant once before, and the waiters remembered him. In fact, they found it profoundly humorous that two guys they&#39;ve met on separate occasions, the guy who frequently eats with a family that speaks Cantonese but cannot really speak it himself and the guy who stopped by a month prior that originally hails from Canada, are close friends. <br><br>As a bonus, one of the waiters is a polyglot and speaks Spanish fluently. <br><br>All of the above adds to the homeyness of this establishment.

By the time I made reservations, there were slim pickings, as I preferred to eat early but not too early. We opted for a 6p seating and headed into the city. No traffic...win. Parking spot right across the street...win. Minimal wait time for our table...win.<br><br>Our server was on point. He set us up and showed us the QR code so that we could order our meal. The one thing that threw us off was that on the app, we kept seeing orders from the table that dined before us so we had to make sure we weren&#39;t going to be charged for food/beverages that were not ours. My Little insisted on soup so she and I ended up sharing a hot pot and the boys with BBQ. Hindsight immediately kicked in as I realized the irony of not wanting to cook a Thanksgiving meal but still ending up cooking my own dinner. It was fun but to be completely honest, I would have preferred the BBQ. Our server cooked the BBQ for the fellas.<br><br>Little and I had beef, lamb and shrimp, along with loads of veggies and some noodz. Their sauce bar was scant my first visit but they restock often which as great. The best combo was mixing cilantro, scallion, chili, sesame oil/spicy oil and fresh garlic. It&#39;s a bomb combo and the only way I would get any spice since sharing the hotpot with a terror tot. The guys had duck, beef, pork belly, lamb, cow tongue and some veggies as well.<br><br>The BBQ was way better IMO as our hot pot burner kept turning off which was concerning. I will give it to our server, who was on top of it and when he noticed the burner was off, he immediately turned it back on and removed the lamb I had just placed on my kid&#39;s plate, returning it to the hotpot to cook. I had already begun eating it and hopefully I don&#39;t get sick (still good the day after) but that kind of turned me off to ordering any more red meat. The burner continuously turned off the entire meal so I had to make sure to watch for the blinking red lights, indicating that it needed to be turned back on. After the lamb fiasco, we had some orders of shrimp and called it a night.<br><br>I definitely could have eaten more but that burner turning off so often had me worried that the pot would not stay the temperature it needed to cook what was in the pot and to prevent anything already in the pot from causing us to get sick. I was not about to take the chance with the kiddo. We paid and left.<br><br>Since it was my birthday my meal was gratis which was nice.

The combination of Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine left my tastebuds delighted as the flavors actually complimented each other. For my visit, I ordered several dishes: Loaded Fries with Dip (side), 5ive Special (Pho), Shaking Beef (Vermicelli), and Beer Battered Fish Tacos.<br><br>Foremost, the pho at this restaurant was truly exceptional. The broth was rich and savory with a pleasant hint of cinnamon. It came with plentiful slices of tender beef and a reasonably sized piece of boneless short rib. The short rib itself was cooked nicely and was topped with a delicious, tangy garnish. The size of the bowl is a bit on the smaller side when compared with other restaurants that serve an &#34;Extra Large Bowl&#34; option. However, it is important to note that the menu did not provide any sizing information for this item.<br><br>The Loaded Fries was a delicious side. It came with several morsels of angus beef briskey and was seasoned with a blend of Mexican spices and Vietnamese sauces.<br><br>Although the Shaking Beef was a fresh and savory dish, it was less appealing than the 5ive Special. The shredded pickled carrots and radish were delicious and added a nice texture to dish along with the lettuce and pickled mustard greens. However, the portion of the beef was a bit upsetting. The beef itself was tender and flavorful, but it seems that the amount of vegetables overwhelmed the dish.<br><br>Lastly, the Beer Battered Fish Tacos was a mouthwatering fusion of Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine, as the flavors perfectly complimented each other. The tacos were served with a side of salsa and fish sauce. The tacos itself was topped with cilantro and shredded pickled carrots and radish. The flavor of this dish was truly distinctive, as it felt like I had taken a bite out of a &#34;breadless&#34; banh mi that was in the form of a taco. The fish was also well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Moreover, the taco shells (coconut rice crepe) also had a distinctive texture that really helped bind the dish together. <br><br>Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant was also charming, with a nice modern, bar-like d\u00e9cor that created an inviting atmosphere. The service was also attentive and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience.<br><br>In conclusion, this Vietnamese-Mexican fusion restaurant exceeded my expectations with its flavorful and delicious pho and creative fusion dishes.

We walked in with a group of 6 and waited at the entrance for almost 10 minutes without a host or server coming up to us. When we tried to flag someone down, they just walked past and ignored us.

Traditional pho I&#39;ve had include more of a salty flavor, it seems this restaurant favors sweet over salty. <br><br>Loaded fries - $9 (1/5)<br>The fries were soggy. The slow roast on top was too sweet and generally did not go well with the fries. The fries tasted like it was unsalted and instead dipped into a tray of bbq flavoring. It reminded me a lot of the bbq pringles. <br><br>Service- 1/5 <br>We came into the restaurant and was greeted by an older gentleman who was rude to us. We asked to have our seat swapped because the seat we initially got was by the door, we both have bad allergies so we requested a change. We were brought to a seat RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE AC. For the whole meal, my partner and I were freezing. <br><br>For the whole time, the waiter did not serve us and it was a combination of waiters. Towards to end, it was until we were ready to pay that the initial waiter attempted to give us any service and attention. <br><br>In addition to this, at the end of the meal when my partner and I were waiting to take turns for the bathroom, the waiter would come by every 2 seconds to see if we had paid, as if he deserved any of the tip we were going to leave. <br><br>Ambiance- 1/5 <br>Cool bathroom. <br><br>Never coming again.

A friend of mine was having a party on the Lower East Side and I wanted to find a restaurant where we could get a great but not too upscale dinner nearby. I checked all of my saved businesses on Google maps and 8282 popped up. I had no memory of saving this spot, but I guess I just blindly clicked that little green flag one day and hoped it would benefit me in the future. Well, future me is proud of past me, because 8282 was exactly what I had hoped for, and then some. Creative, excellent food, an equally impressive cocktail menu, wildly fast service and the bill won&#39;t hurt your wallet too much. We got to the friend&#39;s party exactly when we wanted to, and I got to rave to all who would listen about the amazing meal we&#39;d just had.<br><br>Made a reservation here at 7:30 on a Saturday night. The space itself fairly small, with probably no more than 10-12 small tables in there plus bar seating, It&#39;s very loud and chaotic, but not in a distracting or uncomfortable way. It&#39;s more like, this is the vibe, you get what you come for, sorry if you didn&#39;t do your research. Like I said, fun New York experience. We&#39;ve been to a solid number of Korean fine dining spots (Atomix, Jua, Oiji Mi, etc.) so it was nice to get a relatively more casual experience.<br><br>The first drink I ordered (conveniently the only drink we tried not on the online menu was a gin-based drink with aloe and tea syrup. I asked our server to explain it to me and she said it was like a martini, so I gave it a try. It ended up being more like a gimlet-style drink but not a very good one (I found it kind of watered down and flat), so I sheepishly sent it back. I virtually never do this because it makes me feel like a very bad person, but they were nice about it. My husband, on the other hand, started with the Yuja Pear Tequila Perilla (Citrus splash of yuja &amp; pear, tequila, lime, topped with perilla &amp; perilla oil), which I did not try but he said it was one of the best drinks he ever had. I swapped my first drink for the Oiji Dirty (Korean pickled cucumber (oiji) brine, Rockey&#39;s botanical liqueur, dry vermouth, and Gray Whale gin), which was superb and a unique spin on your typical dirty martini. For our second round, my husband got the Secret Forest (Tanqueray dry gin, Rockey&#39;s botanical liqueur, vermouth, snap pea &amp; green chartreuse syrup, lemon, thyme) which was absolutely fabulous. I got the Miss Persimmon (Persimmon, chai tea syrup, rye whiskey, bitters), which I thought was going to be like a Manhattan but was actually shake and served up (I had weird luck with drinks). That said, it was still super tasty.<br><br>Food-wise, you gotta share here. They recommend 4-5 dishes per two people, but I think that suggestion takes entree-sized dishes into consideration, because we only ordered small plates and we probably could&#39;ve had one more after six. The food is creative, inspired, seasonal and fresh. Lots of bold flavors but overall, still a relatively healthy meal (obviously it depends on what you order). Eats, below:<br><br>Endive Salad (Organic Belgium endive, Asian pear, yogurt, walnut, parsnip): A<br>Super fresh, earthy, light and sweet, love the combo of the pear/yogurt/walnut which has been done many times but in this case it was executed perfectly <br><br>Tuna Tartare + Kim Bukak (4 pcs of bluefin tuna, sesame oil aioli, served on fried seaweed chips topped with uni, capers, and egg custard): A+<br>These were total flavor bombs and one of the stunners of the night.

Then the security guard came out of nowhere to ask if we were doing okay which we thought was strange because the security guard was placed on the level floor and not the 31st floor. And as he walked away he didn&#39;t seem to bother any other tables but ours. Not too long after that our waiter rudely and loudly accused us of smoking weed. When we confirmed that it was two tables that were behind us smoking and not us we all decided that we didn&#39;t want to put up with it anymore. We cancelled our order of sliders and 2 cocktails (that we had been waiting on for more than 20 min) and asked for the check. <br><br>The check comes &amp; we were so shocked that after being treated so rudely and terribly that automatic gratuity was still added onto the bill.

Not only does it have such a fun and summer-y atmosphere, the food is some of the best I have had at a restaurant and the menu is also very creative. <br><br>As an appetizer, we ordered the Goat Cheese and Pistachio Souffl\u00e9. When I read the word &#34;souffl\u00e9,&#34; I was imagining puff pastry enclosing the goat cheese. But to my surprise, the souffl\u00e9 was just made of warm goat cheese that was so airy, it seemed more of a thick foam. I took an endive that had balsamic glaze on it, placed some of the asian pear slices on top, and spread the goat cheese over it. Such an amazing appetizer, I could have ate the whole thing by myself. The crunch of the endive, along with the tangy pear and warm goat cheese made each bit a wonderful experience.<br><br>For my main course, I ordered the Orange Dusted Main Lobster, which is not listed as a salad on the menu, but that&#39;s how the waiter described it to me. It was one of my favorite meals eaten at an American restaurant. The vegetables that the chef chose all complimented the lobster very well, not to mention the slight orange flavor I got from the lobster - how creative! The fava beans were the second most interesting part of the dish (after the orange dusted lobster), as they were so soft and melted in my mouth. I have never seen these types of beans as part of a vegetable medley before.<br><br>My dad ordered the Crispy Sea Bass, which in my opinion, had a very salty and fishy taste to it. However, he really liked his choice. My mom ordered the Pistachio Crusted Tilapia, which had an interesting addition on top of it: a jumbo crab ravioli. I couldn&#39;t figure out why a single ravioli of a different seafood was added on top of the fish, but I really liked it. <br><br>Now, the dessert. Absolutely amazing. We ordered the Banana Split, which is an unusual order for my family as we tend to veer towards a chocolate-based dish, but the waiter was so adamant that the Banana Split was the best so we gave in and decided to give it a shot. Best decision ever. The banana had a br\u00fbl\u00e9e on top of it, giving it a sweet crunch to contrast its mushy texture. Pair that with a small bit of the toasted marshmallow and any one of the three gelatos included, and you have a bite made from heaven.

Bright, colorful, and attractive, which is a lot to admire. I ordered the Peanut Bacon n Jelly chicken sandwich with Ludlow fries for around $23.<br><br>The Ludlow fries were loaded with the typical cheese fry ingredients, but there were subtle differences that made this set of fries stand out to me. When it comes to what makes the cheese fries fundamentally enjoyable, this dish checks off all the boxes. Good quality cheese, satisfying portions of protein (which was what I believe to be bacon in this case), and the jalape\u00f1os with scallions garnished the fries pretty well. What stood out to me was the quality of the fries themselves. They didn&#39;t get too soggy under the sauces, which had great flavor on their own and agreed very nicely with the other ingredients. Each fry held a good amount of potato and the outside was particularly crispy, which I loved. Against the abundance of cheeses and sauces, the texture of the fries was memorable to say the least.<br><br>When it comes to the chicken sandwich, I was a bit skeptical with the whole PB&amp;J idea but I&#39;m so happy I took the chance. The peanut mayo is very potent and it gave a beautiful earthly undertone to the sweetness of the jelly and the largely seasoned flavor of the chicken. The soft bun also helped with providing some extra texture to the tender bite of the chicken and holding all the sauces together. There&#39;s certainly some creative initiative on this sandwich and I wish they made them bigger!

On a different night, two or three times, later in the night after I had left a bar or something of the sort, I was charged more than the menu price -- only after I had returned later, did I realize. When it&#39;s late at night, just ensure you&#39;re paying the menu price and not what you&#39;re told at the register. But this is just an example of a common institutional problem within our global economy: the concept of profit maximization reigning supreme over that of promoting a minimum level of well-being for all humans. We all know there exists a certain price for a slice in Manhattan, depending on the quality. However, we&#39;re all still willing to pay more for more influential/visible brands, such as Papa John&#39;s over a dollar slice shop. But that&#39;s just part of the problem, people buying/using a brand due to an image rather than what the company stands for (outliers such as Patagonia do exist though, when it comes to addressing environmental impacts). Single use plastics have the potential to be, and are already, devastating to modern society. For example, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch ( whose description I&#39;m linking here, and don&#39;t worry I read the entire article before posting it, ( <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.org%2Fencyclopedia%2Fgreat-pacific-garbage-patch%2F&amp;s=ab613ac8232a037f6da49b42667bc27a3513c8d13fa69ead74471215cc5fe3bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nationalgeographic.org/e\u2026</a> ), is just one way in which we&#39;re hurting our world, especially since we&#39;re not utilizing a regenerative economy/society. Not sure how to end this, cause I love the pizza here [especially if it&#39;s fresh] and it&#39;s still cheap as hell, so all in all, a good deal. <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>A centrist who believes in climate change and the necessity of social initiatives.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": null, "reviewCount": 5, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "3/4/2018", "comment": {"text": "Dollar slice pizza is a New York City staple.

So I&#39;d have to live without my sensitive skin exfoliating face wash, clinical protection Secret deodorant, and expensive hair product.

All of a sudden, a larger man comes along, dressed in a long dress with a blond wig and a parrot on his shoulder and small spray painted dog at his feet and he proceeds to shows off his dance moves. As they start to dance together, the crowd begins to cheer for both of them.<br><br>Out of nowhere, a small older Latino man dressed in a little tan suit straight of &#34;Mad Men&#34; starts to get down with his salsa moves. At this point, the crowd erupts into a frenzy. And I don&#39;t blame them. This guy was around 80 years old, but could out dance anyone on the block.

Trust the waitresses when asking for burgers. The flavor is unlike any normal poultry, instead more akin to the flavor and texture of mammals. Ostrich is totally layered with flavors.

Definitely a delicious, healthy beef-alternative.<br><br>***- Wild Boar burger with sweet fried onions- A deeper flavor which seems more natural, it&#39;s that flavor they say wild animals sometimes have. It doesn&#39;t taste like a pork at all. The texture provides an interest, compact yet juicy experience. This is also a good alternative to a hamburger, with a different appeal and theme. Just be prepared for the slightly woodsy flavor.<br><br>** 1/2- Venison burger with mushrooms and provolone- This definitely has a wild, woodsy flavor to it.

There were many specialty pies from BBQ chicken to old fashion pepperoni. To my pleasant surprise, they were selling the cheese slices for only $1.00 each! \u00a0Amazing! \u00a0Of course, the best way to test a NY slice is to order a &#34;cheese slice&#34;.<br><br>So I got on line. It moved quickly. One staff on the register, and another behind the counter leaned over to ask what I wanted. &#34;Cheese slice&#34; I said. \u00a0When I got to the register 2 cheese slices were waiting for me on a paper plate. &#34;Two?&#34; I thought? Oh well at $1.00 each I didn&#39;t complain. Then I noticed they were the last 2 cheese slices from the pie. And before I even picked up my plate, another whole fresh pie came out of the oven to replace the empty pie plate that my 2 slices came from. &#34;Hey&#34; I said. &#34;Can I please swap these out for two fresh from the oven slices? \u00a0Looking at the fresh steaming hot cheese pie.&#34;This os such a tease...&#34;. I lamented \u00a0 To my surprise. They did. Without even the hint of a protest. They immediately swapped out my slices for 2 fresh ones out of the oven. \u00a0 When does THAT happen?

It still is, but you will get a<br>Lot \u00a0closer to that bar in Manhattan than say Seattle or Los Angeles. (Pssst 3 Guys in LA across the street from the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. ) I digress. <br><br>This pizza passes the NY crust test. Thin, crispy but still foldable without cracking. The sauce, can be subjective. I like mine thick and a little sweet but from the tomatoes. Not sugar. <br> Then the oil test. Once folded, you should get an orange stream of oil from the cheese. Not too much, but some. This slice had a little less than I like but it is still an enjoyable and satisfying slice of NYC. \u00a0<br><br>Not quite the gold standard of Brooklyn slices but possibly the closest you will get anywhere near midtown Manhattan.

It has such an unusual location. 9 Tails is located inside a hardware store. For real. The expectation is the coffee would taste like grass or something like that but that would be wrong. <br><br>Coming here was another case of getting off the subway at some random stop and checking out cafes around it. It was a bit of a walk from the 125th Street station and it was super confusing finding it at first because we thought it couldn&#39;t be the correct place. The address is Mushtari Hardware, a hardware store. Only did we know it was the correct place after we read the sandwich board. This said something about coffee and to go that way. Getting to here is by two options. The hardware store has a main entrance on 125th and the back entrance is on 126th, which is the address listed here and on the business website. On 125th you enter on the main floor, while on 126th you enter in the basement. The basement is where you&#39;ll find the coffee shop. It has a small counter. This is purely for takeout. A drip coffee is one of the choices. It&#39;s $3 for a small. The coffee tasted fresh and not like it&#39;s been there a long time. It wouldn&#39;t be unexpected with it being so hard to find. They also have some non dairy milks like oat. Get some breakfast burritos. Many locally made and one is vegan. Each of us got a Vegan Breakfast Chorizo Burrito. It&#39;s $7 and while it&#39;s not big it packs in a lot. This has bell peppers, caramelized onions, Impossible chorizo, pickled daikon, and refried pinto beans and it&#39;s all vegan. Good burrito. They also have some croissants and muffins and a few are vegan so pretty good plant based choices and healthier options. <br><br>Amazing this is in a hardware store but it yes it&#39;s possible to pick up a hose in the same place as coffee.

I saw this place all over instagram and had to give it a try. We went at 4 pm because I cannot wait till later to eat and it was not a place for that. Would say this place is more of a night life moment and I would probably go here with friends if I lived closer. Getting there and back is a bit of a hassle for me. I got the Tom Yum ramen and it was pretty good. The huge prawn was a bit messy but it was so good! I do not think I had a prawn the size of a lobster ever. Wish I wasn&#39;t on a date so I can suck on the heads and really get the most out of it, but it is what it is. I got the Lychee drink and it was pretty good. My drink came with a sparkly rose petal that made my day. The service is pretty good here and they are patient. We sat around a bit after we paid and were done eating/drinking. They did not come and ask us to leave so that was nice. A bit of a tip. Not sure if it works because we totally forgot to use it, but if you check in on your Yelp app, you get 20% off. Do let us know if that is a thing. We forgot to use it.. after I was excited to use it. The one thing that I was a bit suspicious of was that my water tasted like soap. I had my date try my water and he agreed it was a bit off. However, we are alive and my second glass tasted like water so I guess it is fine?

Their food also seemed pretty delicious - I love the concept of Thai and Japanese fusion. <br><br>I saw this place on Tiktok (great place to find visually appealing restaurants) and was pleasantly surprised to see it also had high rating on Yelp. I was sure this place was going to be a rising hot bar and bites place. <br><br>If I were to rate this place on food alone, it&#39;s actually pretty tasty! I enjoyed both of the food items. I was looking for something soupy, so I got the Chashu Tom Yum Ramen ($18), extra spicy. This was exactly what I was expecting - soup had the sour flavor I was hoping to taste, the ramen noodles were standard. The chashu&#39;s flavor was REALLY good, but it was chewier/drier than I would have liked. <br><br>I saw pictures of the Black Panther Curry ($26) before, so I ordered this as well. Kind of pricey for the quantity, but I expect this is because of the ribeye. The ribeye was tasty - it had good texture and flavor, cooked just right! The squid ink fettuccine was fine, but I didn&#39;t like how clumpy it was (hard to separate individual pasta strands without picking up a large chunk with it). The curry itself was exactly what I was hoping for and very tasty. <br><br>If I came in with the focus only being the food, maybe I would have rated this place more highly. Unfortunately there were more factors to this establishment to consider, and the restaurant performed less well in those areas. \u00a0<br><br>The first (smaller) issue was the service. My party made a reservation ahead of time, but when we arrived, there were no tables available. The front of house handled this pretty well however and brought us to the bar to sit and wait and look through the menu since a table was clearing out shortly. <br><br>After we were seated at our table and ordered, my party noticed that the food comes really out slowly - albeit not as slowly as other reviews have mentioned where it&#39;s an hour+ wait. The wait was maybe 40 minutes, but it was frustrating because we already spent time waiting before then even with a reservation. <br><br>When the food was finally served, they didn&#39;t provide a spoon for at least the ramen (I like to have a spoon for the curry as well). Upon asking for spoons, they provided them with bowls promptly. However, with the earlier issues it was hard not to notice the lack of attention to detail. <br><br>While waiting for the table we ordered drinks at the bar, which I (wrongly) thought were going to be the stars of the night. The first drink was a Sua Smash ($16), a familiar tasting drink with an extra herbal hint assumedly from the Thai basil. This drink was fine, but not extraordinary. <br><br>The second drink was the Knockout Tiger ($16). I regret getting this drink.

Besides the entrance being not easily accessible because you need to climb a flight of stairs to reach it, I think of a speakeasy as usually have a more subdued, chill vibe.

There was also quite a generous amount of uni. The cream sauce is a bit thick so I don&#39;t know if the taste would get cloying if you ate it all yourself but split between three of us, it definitely left us wanting more.<br>(2) 11Tigers Ceviche Mixto had quite a kick and got spicier with time but the seafood was very fresh<br>(3) Crying tiger steak - the ribeye steak was good and I like that the texture was a little crunchy from the sesame flakes.

Unfortunately, it has never impressed me. In a city with so many places to get a fast and delicious slice of pizza, I see no reason to stop at 2 Bros. They pizza, for me, is simply adequate. Their slices are not what I look for in a slice of New York Izzy. Of course, this is a highly subjective matter, but I have a particular issue with their crust. I like crust that is doughy with a subtle crunch. I also like the end crust to be big. 2 Bros crust is somewhat cracker like, almost as if it is dry. This is common across all of their slices. Regardless, their toppings and sauces are not bad, I would even say they are around average. With so many great pizza spots nearby in the East Village, I would walk the few extra blocks for great slices at Artichoke Basille&#39;s, Sauce, or East Village Pizza. <br><br>Cheese Slice (2.5/5): This cheese slice really disappointed me. Their cheese has the artificial texture and taste that I dread. It had none of that chewy and stretchy flavor and texture that I know and love. I also can&#39;t get over their crust, it is just too crunchy and dry. It may be the preference of some, but it is not what I look for in a great fast slice.<br><br>White Slice (4/5): White Pizza is my favorite slice of all time. It is hard to complicate and luckily their White Pizza is not that bad. If it weren&#39;t for the crust, I would give this a higher rating. This mozzarella cheese is better than the cheese found on their traditional Cheese Slice. I still would not rank it is highly as I do other options in the area...<br><br>Veggie Slice (3/5): Their Veggie Slice, much like their Cheese Slice, is average. Their toppings are what you would expect and perhaps the portion size is even a little larger than average.

Unfortunately, it seems that their name (886 is the dialing code for Taiwan) is their most authentic feature. It seems they do a good job of selling a very Americanised version of Taiwanese food, which is... I suppose how they market themselves? But also rather disappointing.<br><br>We started with the lo ba beng \u6ef7\u8089\u98ef - not a great start. The flavour of the sauce was not really authentic - overly sweet (?!) and kind of watery/thin. The sauce kind of just seeped through all of the rice and made it more like a \u71c9\u98ef risotto-like texture throughout. There was way too much pickled veggies \u9178\u83dcwhose flavour was too strong, overpowering the balance between the rice and the pork. Finally, the runny soft boiled egg was interesting but also kind of dissonant, lu rou fan is almost always canonically served with braised soy eggs \u6ef7\u86cb\u3002<br><br>I guess to be fair, in an absolute sense the dish was not bad, but as noted above, it really just felt like someone tried to force lu rou fan into an Asian fusion setting. \u800c\u4e14\u9019\u6a23\u9084\u8981 $14\uff1f\u6709\u5920\u8a87\u5f35\u7684<br><br>We also had the scallion pancake beef wrap \u725b\u8089\u6372\u9905. The beef and pancake were tasty, but I couldn&#39;t focus on anything other than the random mayo that they added. I get that the &#39;szedaddy&#39; mayo is a thing they&#39;re trying to do, but not only does it screams inauthenticity, it is a really odd flavour combo with the lighter flavours of the stewed beef and the savoury scallion pancake wrapper.

The noodles were nice - generally well-cooked at a nice degree of chewiness - and the beef bites were not bad - a little too hard for my taste but overall good flavour. The broth I did find to be a little lacking; it was much thicker and saltier than beef noodle soup normally is, and it really weighed down the overall flavour profile of the dish. <br><br>The environment is a bit disconcerting in my opinion - lighting was really strong as you can tell by the photos - and the layout makes it a bit loud as the sound echoes around the relatively small space very easily.

I had a minor issue about not being notified that there was a table limit for 90minutes and not being able to order food because the waiter only came back once to ask if we needed another drink. I went again on Friday, St. Patrick&#39;s Day, knowing it would be busy. I asked if there was any available seating for 3 and was told a line was formed across the street. The people I was meeting up hadn&#39;t arrived so I joined the line. Every 15minutes the manager kept coming to ask everyone how many people were in the party to see who can be seated. This was the same gentleman who told me about the line. I waited for an hour and I made it to the front of the line. One of my friends greeted the bouncer and checked to see how long the wait would be we were told 10minutes. After 20min he asked again because more then 6 people left so a table was available. We were told we could go in. The same manager who saw me outside waiting and told me about the line saw me enter and there was no issue. After sitting down a different manager (guy with braids) stated we needed to leave and tried to kick us out. He&#39;s ex&#39;s act words were &#34; who told you you can sit here. You need to get out. Get out.&#34; My friend went to talk to the manager and the bouncer calmly to find out the issue. The manager claimed we paid the bouncer. I no way did we pay to get in. As that was going on a waiter came to the table and told me and my other friend we had to leave because someone claims I cut them in the line. Again I was at the front of the line, no one was in front of me and I spent an hour and 20minutes waiting. After resolving the issue with management they said we could stay. No apology from management for a problem they caused and nothing about the guys who made a scene. The waiter came back and gave us water as an apology and told us about a 60minute table time. We ordered our drinks and food quickly because we didn&#39;t want another problem. My friend ordered hot wings(all flats) and they were not great. We continued on and determined maybe we will try another time only because the music was good and drinks weren&#39;t bad. The waiter was polite and the only saving grace. We got the bill it came out to $123. I paid with a debt card and signed the receipt. We gave a tip in cash. The next day I saw a charge for more then the $123. I checked both receipts again the first one with $123 and the second one with $128. I saw a fee was added but no specifications on the second one. I thought it was a card fee but it wasn&#39;t. My receipt said card fee would be applied for a credit card and it would be three and change not $5. I am livid. Not only did we have a hard time to start but then you add a fee after you take the card. To charge an additional fee after the agreed upon amount is illegal. \u00a0I will not be going back.

If you want to try an assortment of drinks for cheap, you can choose from a lengthy list. They do not make you any custom drinks, so don&#39;t even bother asking. Their drinks are strong and if the mixed drinks don&#39;t mess you up, just take a $3 shot.<br><br>I generally stick with the mojito or the Long Island iced tea but I have tried many of the other ones. They&#39;re all pretty good. My guy friends tend to like the Adios M (previously known as Adios Motherf*cker). Most likely because of the name and the bright blue coloring of it. Don&#39;t expect a drink with lots of layers of flavoring, they are only $6.<br><br>For the food, I don&#39;t suggest getting anything that is not fried. I tried one of their dinner combos a few years ago and I was super disappointed. I can barely remember it because it lacked so much in flavor that I tried to throw the memory out. <br><br>My favorites are the cajun fries and the mushroom quesadilla. Usually we order a basket of the fries and keep ordering as we go on into the night. They are thin and coated in the cajun powder. So good! The mushroom quesadilla is a good option for your vegetarian friends. You can share the slices or eat the whole thing if you want. The fried calamari is okay, not my favorite but I&#39;ll eat it if it&#39;s in front of me.<br><br>Overall, a great place to come with friends if you want to get drunk.

The chili taco is nothing to write home about but it gets the job done, coming and going. <br><br>My order consisted of a steak tostada salad. It&#39;s your basic lettuce, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, shredded cheddar salad topped with steak fajita, grilled onions and green pepper, all cradled in a deep fried flour tortilla the approximate shape of an inverted lampshade. <br>Was it reasonably healthy? Check, the ingredients were fresh and crispy. Steak, lean. <br><br>Was it tasty and filling? Check, the proteins were not over seasoned and thoroughly grilled (maybe a bit overdone for my taste but, expectations, right?) <br><br>Was it pretty standard in comparison to other tostada salads? <br><br>This is where 211 keeps it real...NOT ONLY were the aforementioned ingredients present and fresh, but instead of diced tomatoes, you get a few cherry tomatoes. Additionally, the dish is kicked up a notch with red onion, two slices of cucumber and...are you sitting down?... A LIME WEDGE!! Holy smokes, 211 up in that food game bucking the status quo. All in all, worth the $12 +$5 dollar price of admission. <br>A notable absence was the weird tomatillo-esque sauce that&#39;s usually included with anything one orders from this type of establishment, but the lime wedge makes up for it. <br>A thankful absence was the runny sour cream that&#39;s usually included with everything one orders from this type of establishment...seriously you&#39;re gonna trust the white guy that started Taco Bell for pumping that crap into every menu item and your arteries, but not the Asian guy for doing their version of fajitas?<br><br>All in all a decent meal, delivered quickly but at a premium in price compared to picking up at the restaurant.

I ordered the double cheeseburger with everything on it and an order of fries. I fortuitously asked for the house sauce on the side, but more on that below.<br><br>Let me first disavow anyone of comparisons to In n Out or even Five Guys. Yes they have their house sauce, which invites the comparison to animal style at In n Out, but that is as far as it goes. The fries here are not freshly cut as one finds at In n Out and Five Guys or at least they do not taste freshly cut by hand. The burger is a very greasy affair, well beyond In n Out and even Five Guys. The burger wrapper is soaked in grease and it soaks through the white paper bag. For those who have the palate for all that grease or if you are in need of such to recover from the previous night&#39;s drinking, well this is right up your alley. For the rest of us, it is a challenging affair and the bun, quality as it might be, is not up to the challenge and task of maintaining its structural integrity. This is a burger prone to falling apart and, for those who like that sort of thing, well have at it here at 7th Street Burger.<br><br>Now a word on the house sauce is warranted. I asked for it on the side after I ordered the burger. I was going to put it on the burger, but the burger and bun were already too challenged, as I mentioned above. However, the fries definitely benefitted from their house sauce. As best as I could tell, the sauce is mayonnaise or Thousand Island, mustard and some unami or truffle accord. I doubt if there is actual truffle oil, but there is some inescapable savory note in this sauce that works well with the fries. They offer their fully loaded fries from this sauce mixed with burger meat or Impossible meat.

But I am giving the restaurant two extra stars, one for a very pleasant bartender. The second star is simply because, in this neighborhood, we need to encourage any place which is not a deep-ethnic establishment and which is intended for an Anglo clientele. (Dominican food places are a dime-a-dozen here, but some of us don&#39;t particularly like this type of food.)<br><br>Anyhow, my vegetarian omelette was a pretty sorry piece of work. First of all, the cook was an hour late in showing up this morning. So we had to hang around and sip our beverages while he deigned to show. But it would have been better if he had not. The supposed 3-egg omelette was basically made with 1.5 eggs, then foamed up, then burned on the griddle. Absolutely nothing satisfying about such a meal.<br><br>Well then, how about the sides? Yeah, how about the sides? The menu says omelettes come with potatoes. Well, apparently they ran out of potatoes, since my omelette was served with a small bit of green salad. Very unsatisfying. To boot, no bread is served. You generally expect an omelette breakfast to include toast of some kind on the side, but not here. &#34;You gets no bread with one meat ball!&#34; That was a Depression-era folk song, but at 181 Cabrini, &#34;you gets no bread with your omelette.&#34; Come on folks, quit being so stingy. Sure, some customers will want bread omitted, but you will make others unhappy if you have an across the board policy of no bread.<br><br>Another gotcha is that the Breakfast menu is not served on weekends. On weekends, you have to order from the Brunch menu, where the prices are jacked up. Well, if the food were good, we&#39;d worry about the prices, but that decision does not need to be reached, since you won&#39;t get good food.<br><br>Conclusion: You are much better off going to Sugar Hill Cafe for your breakfast.

Just to clarify, this restaurant is not Hong Kong style dim sum place. It&#39;s Shanghai style cuisine. Here are our dishes and my scoring and opinion:<br>- Noodles w. scallion oil (8/10): I had my doubt when I saw the plate. For the authentic noodle with scallion oil, the color is usually darker because of the soy sauce and the scallions are fried with stripe shape. I mixed the noodles a bit before eating and I was impressed after my first bite. The flavor is very authentic just like the way I had when I was in Shanghai. If the scallion flavor is stronger, it would be perfect. <br>- Shredded chinese radish puffs (9/10): The puffs are crispy outside and soft inside. They were freshly made and the radish inside taste so good. The only downside is a bit doughy right beneath the crispy skin.<br>- Sticky rice shumai (5/10): we were disappointed with the shumai. There&#39;s no flavor at all. It suppose to have shiitake mushroom pieces and ground pork to create the flavor, but I barely found those material in the shumai. It&#39;s just like rice ball in the wrap. <br>- Soup dumpling with pork (7/10): Neither impressed or disappointed. It is decent and similar to the ones in other restaurants. <br>- Cha siu bun (7/10): I think they are the frozen ones bought from supermarket. The filling is sweet but not much meat in it.

Comparing 7th st&#39;s burger to smilar styles, it is far and few between the BEST burger or at least top 5 for me at the moment. Starting with the bun, it was incredibly soft and fluffy with the meat perfectly complementing every bite of that burger with a crisp meat crust and juicy patty. With every bite of this burger I was wanting more and more! The house sauce is thousand island style sauce but 100 times better! The burger was by far the star of the show. I was hoping the fries would be some of the better ones that I&#39;ve had, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Fries were mid at best and in my opinion worth it to skip. <br><br>All in all, @7thstburgernyc is a must try! Go get that burger asap and let me know what you think.<br><br>Rating: 8.9/10<br><br>IG: @mrtravelfoodie", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 2019, "reviewCount": 235, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "5/11/2022", "comment": {"text": "I LOVED LOVED LOVED this Elite Event!!!!<br>To be honest, I was shocked by this place and I&#39;ll explain why...<br><br>I decided to take a look at the reviews before making our way to 7th Street Burger and thought: &#34;well... another &#34;regular&#34; burger place.

Perusing the menu and seeing an outrageously priced lobster pasta dish reminded me of the tremendous failure of dinner at Sei Less, so I decided to stay on the cheaper side, not even considering my usual double entree.<br><br>I landed on the Santorini Burger--a $26 Greek-influenced dish that, thank the lord, includes fries, and features a patty made with a lamb and beef blend. This isn&#39;t the first restaurant to offer a lamb burger with a specialty cheese, but it had better be great at this price point.<br><br>As soon as the food had taken just a moment too long, I exchanged a glance with the bartender, and she acknowledged that it was time to check on the burger.<br><br>The burger arrived and looked okay. However, it was quickly established that it would be the most disappointing burger at an elevated price point that I&#39;ve ever had. And it&#39;s funny that this category exists for me, but after I got fleeced on the $25 burger special at Jeffrey&#39;s Grocery up the street last week, it&#39;s really important to highlight that restaurants seem to half-ass their entry-level menu items when they think they can get away with it.<br><br>The bun was terrible. The top was cold--cold--to the touch. Meanwhile, the bottom had char marks on it yet wasn&#39;t warm. Weird. The consistency of the bun was three-day-old grocery store brioche. Grainy and actually cleaved a bit as I chomped into it. The menu lists &#34;pita&#34; under the description for this item, but this just adds to my confusion. The menu also lists &#34;charred tomato&#34; but instead my burger contained a thick cut raw tomato. Not just raw, but an icy cold, just out of the freezer slice. The red onions were also icy cold. And so was the inch-thick stack of arugula or whatever it was. Spinach would have been my first choice there. It was stacked too high to eat in a neat manner, and the unfurling springy arugula splattered the tzatziki sauce up my nose at one point.<br><br>The patty itself was overcooked and was just kind of sad. For a place that appears to be made for Instagram, the centerpiece of this dish was buried under inches of cold vegetables. At the angle of the picture I took, the patty was hidden by the shadow of the gaping brioche roll. Small patty that was cooked poorly, stacked laughably, and tasted badly.<br><br>I complained about the burger, about the coldness and doneness, and the bartender seemed to entertain my complaint and said she would share it with the kitchen.

The hostess, who is arguably the rudest hostess I&#39;ve encountered in my 17 years of living in NYC, told us that she would seat us, but we were late and they were going to need the table back as there are other reservations. We were 8 mins late, not 30 mins...that is such a ridiculous thing to say. So then the waitress came. As a party of 3, we ordered 4 appetizers - the octopus, crisps, tuna tartare, and saganaki. They were all quite good. Made us excited for the main dishes...however, they were mediocre. \u00a0We had the zucchini puttanesca (which was good), the burger (which was over cooked) and the lobster pasta (which had amazing presentation but fell massively flat...especially for $78!). They got one of our side dishes wrong. We then ordered 3 desserts...of which only two were brought out. No one knows what happened to the third. The cookie dish was very good; the other was okay. The cocktails were great (they really did this well). The wine was underwhelming -- they didn&#39;t have many of the bottles on their menu and jammed us with something mediocre (they didn&#39;t have several bottles from the menu we requested). The inside was a little loud. And then, after paying $800 for our dinner for 3...the hostess came up to our table with the opening line of &#34;Hi, you&#39;ve been at your table for 3 hours and have exceeded your limit. We need to give your table to someone else. But you&#39;re welcome to go to the bar.&#34; Now, we had just paid the bill (less than five minutes earlier). Look, there is a right way and a wrong way to handle that -- and she handled it horribly. Her tone. Her approach. Everything was rude. The whole beginning and ending of the evening was completely ruined by her. <br><br>We chalked a lot of their misses up to them being new (only open 3 weeks) but the level of service was the tipping point and the reason I feel compelled to share this review. Just a massive failure. I feel like to compete in the top tier of restaurants in this neighborhood (and city) you have to have that down...and this hostess was a rude jerk (PG version) and completely ruined our evening which is unfortunate. \u00a0We have no intention of going back and would not recommend it to any of our friends. I&#39;m sorry -- but if you want to be successful in the West Village, you need to do much better. Hopefully they get it together. <br><br>Btw. We ate at Crown Shy last night.

Great garlic and herb flavors, a must try but it does get heavy and filling. <br>- Prime Rib (Chicago Cut)- wow sooo good and juicy! We got medium rare but I usually like it a bit more cooked. The extra salt was a nice touch but I think it was flavorful enough without adding extra (got a bit salty when adding extra). <br>- Cheeseburger- the server recommended adding bacon and an egg, get it!

As you can see in the below picture, I got the burger with golden fries and a cold brew since it was a brunch based menu.

Don&#39;t get the coffee here.<br><br>Ambiance was very luxurious and posh which was cool, the servers were nice and prompt so I have no complaints there.<br><br>Overall - this place is worth experiencing once and that&#39;s it. \u00a0The food was good but nothing special and given how impossible a reservation is to get here, it was very disappointing. \u00a0I&#39;m going to au cheval before I try to book this again for the burger.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 3}, {"photoCount": 59, "reviewCount": 67, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "9/30/2023", "comment": {"text": "I woke up at 6am PT multiple days in a row to get a reservation here a few weeks in advance of my visit to NY.

For me, a porterhouse is good when you don&#39;t need any sauce/pairings to go with it, but here, we definitely did.

There was a server that mainly stayed in the outdoor area frequently checking on the customers that were seated outside, which was nice. <br><br>My friend and I decided to share 2 dishes together to try a bit of everything.

The shakshuka is solid. It&#39;s exactly like what you expect - Tomato based sauce with 2 eggs. It also comes with Israeli salad and bread on the side, which was nice. The bread might help you get full, but overall, it&#39;s more of a side order or appetizer in a way. But, I did enjoy it like I had expected to. <br><br>SHIPUDIM<br>First of all, the presentation of the dish is 10/10. The way they placed the skewers on a wooden surface like a charcuterie board, the way they added the spicy cherry tomato salad on top with the tahini on the bottom of the skewers was so visually appealing. So that won points right off the bat! <br>Secondly, everything on the board was delicious. The meat slid right off the metal rod. I was pleasantly surprised how soft the meat was to bite into. The cherry tomato was as you expect. The way they made the salad &#34;spicy&#34; was adding thin slices of peppers, but it really wasn&#39;t too spicy at all. It added some nice kick, but nothing anyone can&#39;t handle. They also gave an abundant amount of potatoes with this dish. This alone can help you become full within minutes. <br><br>Overall, I loved everything that I had tried. Maybe it&#39;s because I think I ordered well for my first visit, I really did enjoy my meal as a whole. I think shakshuka is a solid and well known choice and it didn&#39;t disappoint.

We actually wound up eating only 20 minutes after our reservation time and we sat in the outdoor seating area which was very comfortable with the heaters.<br><br>We had an outstanding and personable waiter named Asef who really cared about our dining experience and conversed with us for a while at the end of our meal. We started with hummus and pita, which were outstanding, and we did request additional pita and we still had hummus left over! We had the 12 chairs salad which had a delicious dressing and the grapefruit was a nice touch. We both had the Moroccan fish that came with couscous. It had the perfect amount of spice and again a large portion. Even though we were incredibly full we opted to have dessert and the chocolate mousse with angel hair halva and pistachios was so perfectly rich! We didn&#39;t leave a drop. The tea nana (tea with mint) was a great end to the meal. <br><br>This was such a fun and delicious dining experience.

While the food was okay, I&#39;m not sure what the hype is. I decided to make a last minute reservation on a Saturday. Given how crowded it was that day, it seemed like a smart move.

Seems like a great start so far. <br><br>I was completely overwhelmed by the atmosphere of this place that it ruined my taste for the food. The music was really loud, the crowd was loud, the tables were really cramped in there. We ordered a few things to share and each had a main. I&#39;d say portions are on the generous side. We split falafel and tahini, grilled halloumi, and baladi eggplant. I had a western omelette and my partner had the Borek (cigar dough filled with potato puree and runny egg, folded into a pocket and fried). I thought the shareable sides were pretty good. I liked the eggplant, and it&#39;s an ample portion. The omelette here is gigantic, looks like half a skillet. My partner liked his Borek dish. I thought the food, while very generous, was good. It&#39;s just hard to justify my desire to return because of the atmosphere. I can&#39;t speak for a less busy time of the day.

The ingredients are fresh, decent portion size and lots of topping options for personalization. The dough tastes great and was cooked crispy enough -- it light/airy but yet filling. Sauce was tasty as well; tangy and zesty. I had the margherita pizza substituted w/ burrata cheese -- BEST DECISION EVER! You could really taste the difference. I asked for caramelized onions but when it initially came out he forgot to add it so he brought out another pie for us w/ caramelized onions!! Really appreciated that level customer service - very thoughtful and a good move. <br><br>As an app we had the hot honey fried burrata which was incredible!! Very delicious and unique flavor. It was somewhat small in size but very yummy , probably would get it again. \u00a0<br><br>This is a great spot and they deliver as well!

I can get a good sandwich in RI, but it&#39;s take-out only without a full deli experience.<br>The 2nd Ave Deli gives the full experience I&#39;m looking for without the tourist crowd at Katz&#39;s (though if I&#39;m honest the decor at the tables here is perhaps working a bit too hard to make sure I know that I&#39;m in the 2nd. Ave. Deli (cue the placemats, private label on the mustard, and the dividers between the narrow hall and tables proclaiming where I&#39;m sitting). Maybe that&#39;s because the deli counter is a bit further away and separated from the seating area than is common in most delis? Also, said seating area is a bit cleaner and more comfortable than most others (no complaints about that last fact from me).<br><br>I loved the big plate of pickles served without us having to ask - both half and full sour so I didn&#39;t have to choose just one! I also loved the way my matzoh ball soup was served: cooked carrots and (large) matzoh ball in the bowl, with a metal cup of soup in the middle. As the waiter brought over the bowl, he poured the soup over the carrots &amp; the (I already mentioned, large) matzoh ball. Nu, so elegant! The matzoh ball was light and fluffy too, just the way I like them; no sinkers for me please. The carrots were NOT the soggy cooked-in-the-soup ones my Bubbe would have fed me either; these were cooked just right for balance with the yummy fluffy matzoh ball. This soup? I didn&#39;t even need to add salt!<br><br>The corned beef on rye was appropriately overstuffed. I heeded the warnings and didn&#39;t order lean or extra lean so it was juicy. And so tender.

I haven&#39;t had an egg cream in about 35 years - since my mother refused to make them after she stopped having those schpritz bottles of seltzer delivered to our house. It was the same seltzer &amp; chocolate syrup drink I mostly refused as a kid because they were... weird.

That has now changed, I have tried it. I got myself on a subway to Midtown, made the walk, and ate food here.<br><br>This is the food of my culture, so I take this pretty seriously. It also helps I am now back in the area where Kosher/Jewish delis are somewhat more abundant than where I used to live, where there was maybe one or two delis, or none at all.<br><br>Without further ado, here is what I thought.<br><br>The restaurant is clean, reminiscent of the Jewish delis from the first half of the twentieth century, particularly those right here in New York. The menu is also extensive, and when I found out they cure all their meats in house, I had to dive in. I got a matzo ball soup, a small sampling of pastrami, a side of kasha varnishkas, and for my sandwich, a club of corned beef, tongue, and soft salami. <br><br>First came the soup. The matzo ball soup is something that I feel is the backbone to any Jewish deli. A good one sets the meal up nicely; a poor one can set it back. Unfortunately, it is the latter. Overcooked noodles, and an undercooked matzo ball. The chicken broth is pleasant and smooth, but too many noodles sink to the bottom. The carrots in the soup at least add a nice touch. <br><br>With the soup comes the complementary pickles and coleslaw. Now they are two schools of thought to the coleslaw game, either it can be vinegar or mayo based. This restaurant chooses the former for its slaw. I am not a fan of this style; too runny and stringy for me. The pickles are too soft, no crunch to these briny cucumbers. They fall flat.<br><br>Then my sample of pastrami came out. I like a good pastrami, salty and soft, but not too stringy. This one was bone dry. Plenty of mustard will be needed to make this work. I was prepared for a mediocre experience, but then, with the next few dishes, my luck began to improve.<br><br>The sandwich came next, with the kasha. The corned beef just melts in your mouth, delicious flavor and feel. The tongue follows next, and it is a soft, chewy, melty flavor that works exquisitely. Lastly, the salami comes, and it rounds out the sandwich nicely with a cured flavor to balance things out. This time, the coleslaw given is mayo based, and this really helps give the sandwich a good zing. It also helps the sandwich is served with seedless rye, enabling it be more easily digested. I used mustard, but these meats do not need it. That is why it works.<br><br>Alternating between sandwich bites, I got some hit of the kasha. The kasha is okay, has good taste, and the bow tie pasta is cooked perfectly. It does go a bit overkill on the onion and onion powder, so I could not eat it all. However, after many years of not having a restaurant do it right, it is nice to have one that does. Maybe next time I will try the mushroom barley.<br><br>At the end of the meal, they give you a complementary shot of a New York egg cream. A nice way to end things and help move things along in your stomach just a little bit faster. Definitely do not pass this up.<br><br>After saving itself with a good sandwich, I would also say to not pass this restaurant up. Come to Murray Hill and enjoy a good sandwich from here.

Absolutely life changing, just smelling it gives you a high.

It&#39;s like a sweet, savory, and tart explosion in your mouth. It brings a brightness to the bread, and if you do a double whammy and dip the bread in the two dips it&#39;s truly a game changer. 10/10 <br><br>Bread (complimentary): no words. 99999999999/10<br><br>Salad: <br><br>$17.50 Mediterranean Salad: cranberry, walnuts, apple, red beets, arugula, goat cheese, \u00e7ka ka qellu dressing.<br><br>It&#39;s a solid salad. Is it worth $17.50? Maybe not. It&#39;s delicious however the portion is the size of a side salad. I would get it again thought because it just compliments the meat so nicely. 7/10<br><br>$15.50 Shop Salad: chopped cucumber, tomatoes, red pepper, and shredded feta cheese in olive oil &amp; vinegar<br><br>This is a pretty standard cucumber tomato salad, I like the addition of a shaved feta as opposed to chunks because it was able to coat everything . Pretty solid, but nothing game changing. 7/10 <br><br>Entrees: <br><br>$22.50 Tava Kosi: lamb and rice baked with a mixture of yogurt and eggs added to a roux.<br><br>This dish is so interesting. It&#39;s kind of like a cross between risotto and congee?? The rice is mixed into the yogurt and egg creating an extremely creamy concoction, so if you&#39;re not into that I would order this. I&#39;m not much of a lamb person because of the gaminess and smell, however this looked so interesting and I had to try it. There is still the distinct smell of lamb, however it was cooked extremely well I couldn&#39;t taste the gaminess and it was fall of the bone tender. I wasn&#39;t a very big fan of the rice, but if you want something creamy, hearty and lamb-ey I would order it. Personally this was a 2/10 but to someone who enjoys those things it could be a 10/10. <br><br>$21 Sarma: cabbage leaves stuffed with ground veal, rice, vegetables, and seasoning<br><br>The dish was a lot more creamy than I expected given that these cabbage rolls were stewed in a tomato based sauce. \u00a0Its salty and a had a lot of umami, I think it would taste great with rice but that&#39;s just the Asian in me. I think I would&#39;ve liked to see an element of brightness because I couldn&#39;t get through more than 2 bites without needing to break it up with something. Maybe I&#39;m not accustomed to these flavors and dishes, but I just wish the dish had more components because there was just a cream sauce (sour cream?) on top. 4/10 <br><br>$22 Mixed Grill Platter: combination of qebapa, qofte &amp; sausage.<br><br>Highly recommend ordering this on your first time here! We wanted to try a variation of meats and this was the best way to do it. The Qebaba was my absolute favorite I came back 2 days later and ordered it standalone. The other meats were pretty good too though. The slaw that it comes with is so refreshing and a great add to break the heaviness up I just wish there was more. 9.7/10<br><br>Dessert: <br>$10.50 Baklava: I knew we had to try this because we overheard a guy say that he&#39;s tried a bunch of Baklava places and this one was the best. I&#39;m not Baklava person, but this was pretty solid. Not too sweet, a generous amount of pistachios and a generous portion. I just wish it was more flakey and less soggy but I don&#39;t if that&#39;s just a Baklava thing. The check took a while to come though so we got bored and counted the layers. There&#39;s 43 of them. 5/10 <br><br>Service: <br><br>I would come here with the intention of staying for at least an hour because they&#39;re a little short on waitstaff. I came once at 3pm on a Sunday and didn&#39;t have to wait for a table of 2. There were only 2 waitress from what I could see and it took a little long to get our food BUT they are the nicest ladies ever and I love them with my whole heart. I would say this lunch/dinner would last you 1.5-2 hours. <br><br>Overall Review: 9.5/10<br><br>TRY THIS BREAD IF THIS IS THE LAST THING YOU DO ON THIS EARTH!!!!! I would honestly just come back for the dips and bread, they are splendid. A perfect meal here for me would be the 2 dips (Tarator, Ajavar), lots of bread, Chopped and Mediterranean salads and the sausage platter.

Of every dish it was probably the weakest, but I still really liked it.<br><br>Next we had the mantia - this was my favorite dish of the entire meal. They&#39;re veal dumplings, but very different from say pierogies or pelmeni. They&#39;re crispier and flaky and just absolutely delicious. We also had the mixed grill platter and the meats were all delicious.<br><br>We finished with the trile\u00e7e which has a funny story - my mom and I are Mexican so I grew up on tres leches cake, and noticed &#34;trile\u00e7e&#34; sounds a lot like tres leches. Lo and behold, it was basically a tres leches cake covered in caramel. Apparently Albanians LOVE telenovelas, and saw it in a telenovela and started making it their own. It tasted similar, but slightly different, and was a delicious spin off.

We showed up for a late dinner, probably around 8 pm, and the place was EMPTY. Completely empty. It made for a rather uncomfortable dining experience. <br><br>We were greeted and told we could choose to sit wherever we wanted. My boyfriend suggested a four-top booth in the corner, and half jokingly I quipped about how we shouldn&#39;t take up a four-top when we&#39;re only two people. The host (waiter? Unsure) stepped in and offered to make the booth a two-top. I mean, come on- the place is empty...I&#39;ve worked in restaurants before and while not a huge deal, he should have told us it was no problem for us to occupy that booth. My standards for service are high, though, having dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the city, but I believe it&#39;s the component that separates the good from the great. <br><br>We were brought out menus. My boyfriend ordered a glass of chianti and I think I ordered the cabernet sauvignon if I remember correctly. Our waiter came back out and told me they didn&#39;t have the wine I ordered (it was probably one of 5 reds by the glass, shouldn&#39;t be that hard to keep in stock). So I settled for a glass of chianti as well which was a lovely, light red. <br><br>Now, the bread. It was served with olive oil and balsamic, and the balsamic was some of the most piss poor (excuse my language) I&#39;ve ever had before in my life. It tasted like $2/bottle balsamic, to be honest. My boyfriend and I split the charcuterie and cheese board as an appetizer, which was fine- the prosciutto was nice. There were two different types of parm though as far as I can tell, which were mixed together in one pile. <br><br>This restaurant saves itself with the pasta. I got the Trofie Al Ragu Di Manzo, which was pasta with braised short ribs and pomodoro. My boyfriend got the pappardelle with duck ragu. Both were absolutely delicious and generous portion sizes, and really the only reason I gave this place even three stars. The service for the rest of the night was rather inattentive and slow. Total bill came to roughly $80 pre-tip.

Just off my morning visit for a week I was spending $175. On the first visit, I so signs up such as no cell phone use, no pictures, and Don&#39;t give your order until the worker asks. Not very professional but I brushed it off and tried to understand the reasoning. I respectfully asked if I could take a picture of a bag of chips I had never seen before and the worker that prepared the food said sure. I explained why I was asking because of the posted signs. For most of my visits, the guy making the food seemed okay. The guy ringing up the food was okay. Each time I came I was respectful and patient. One time a different guy made my sandwich and it was way too salted. I brushed it off. I brush off the duct tape on the ceiling right above your head when you order. I tried my hardest to brush off the big fly that was in the case with the food toppings. (This seems like the reason they Don&#39;t want customers taking pictures). I continued to go because my daughter liked her sandwich and I Don&#39;t have a deli in the upscaled area we live. However, after the worker made an error on my sandwich I politely let him know the next day to ensure he didn&#39;t make the same error that day. Now when he made the error there was a nasty AA NYCHA female trying to skip people as they order. My order was already in so I&#39;m not sure if she was the cause of him making the error or simply himself but either way I did nothing wrong to him. When I informed him of his error the next day he wanted me to say my two orders one at a time so I did. He was very unwelcoming but I didn&#39;t catch on till yesterday 07/07/2023. The Hispanic customer asked me if I ordered and said no he still went passed and then greeted the worker in Spanish he said hi to him. Then he looked at me and there was no greeting just more like what do you want? (Yes, I was on the phone with the person I was purchasing one of the sandwiches for. I was not distracted by the call or holding up his line and he was the one that said I could use the phone. If I&#39;m speaking with the person before him saying anything to clarify their order. So that&#39;s not an excuse. I looked right at him with no greeting and no thank you but in the past he did. Whatever his issues are is just that his issues). So I said the first order and then he didn&#39;t even let me say my second one he just called over me to the Hispanic guy and asked him for his order so I never got to place my second order. Then it was like here when he placed the one sandwich order on the counter. I turned around and walked right out. It&#39;s their loss, not mines that between $175 and $180 a week (not counting going in the afternoons because that would be over $200) they loss being unprofessional and having an attitude with a customer that has been nothing but pleasant, a high paying consumer, and stood up for him when the ghetto NYCHA female was being disrespectful. I will take my money somewhere else that probably isn&#39;t going to even charge that much for 2 heroes, 3 bags of chips, two bottles of Dollar Arizona juices, and two packs of peanut chews.

In my hotpot, I like to add lotus root, black fungus (mu er), and the four types of mushrooms they have. It&#39;s always super flavorful. I usually get it spicy but for people who are expecting ma la tang, it&#39;s mostly just spicy because they don&#39;t add many peppercorns. I personally like this better. I also add their homemade chili oil for extra spice!<br><br>The only downside is the price. It is a bit expensive compared to Chinese food from Chinatown or Flushing. They charge by weight if you do the make your own hotpot option. Last time I was here, my hotpot cost $38 which we split between three people. I would recommend getting more vegetables than weight if you&#39;re worried about price because they charge those separately and veggies are cheaper. <br><br>For those who are daunted by the make your own hotpot option, the premade dishes are also good. I&#39;ve had the beef in chili oil &amp; pork in chili oil and both are delicious!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 329, "reviewCount": 164, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "2/27/2020", "comment": {"text": "This place is always busy!

I ordered a Rizogalo (rice pudding) that we both planned on sharing (key word, PLANNED lol). <br><br>First off, A star is immediately deducted from their overall rating simply due to the delivery time. The order was placed on off peak hours so delivering to our location, which was 7 blocks from the restaurant, should not have taken over an hour. We called around the 50 minute mark and the woman who answered said it takes time to prepare the food. Ironically the food still arrived lukewarm. <br><br>As for the food itself, I was fortunate my friend had dressing in her house or else I would have just had a bland salad. They were extremely stingy with the feta to where it was barely visible. I could not take more than 2 bites of the spinach pie without having the feeling to regurgitate and proceeded to trash it. My friend ate her chicken gyro sandwich but stated it was just &#34;meh&#34; and &#34;nothing extraordinary.&#34; Remember that Rizogalo we planned on sharing? I guess the restaurant had different plans lol because it never came with the order. I&#39;m not sure if they charged us for it or if they deducted it from the total amount due, but communication is key. If our order was being modified in any way, we should have been contacted. <br><br>I was always taught to find the finer qualities in people, or rather establishments in this case.

But this place is pretty horrible and the attitude of it is very weird and off-putting. The first interaction, I was in the area because my friend works around the corner and he wanted to get me a belated birthday lunch. We had pizza a few doors down at Grimaldi&#39;s and we were looking for desert and a cocktail. We inquired with whoever was standing out near the entrance and he was like &#34;well no, we can&#39;t get you drinks&#34;, rather rudely. &#34;But what if we ordered deserts with our drinks?&#34; &#34;No, you&#39;d have to order either entrees or appetizers.&#34; &#34;We just ate actually but we were looking for desert and drinks since its her birthday, but thanks!&#34; So that transpired.<br><br>Stupidly we decided to come back the following week for lunch when I needed to pick up keys to watch my friend&#39;s cats. I think we were sold on the margarita sign. Never get suckered in with signs. We sat down to a nice area. Though it was windy and whatever cotton seed plants were nearby kept getting into our food and drinks. I ordered a mango margarita and my friend got a mint julep. Both of the drinks were non-drinkable. It didn&#39;t taste like mango. It tasted like lemon dish soap and just an over-pour of tequila to try and compensate the horrid tastes going on. I have no idea who bartends but they don&#39;t know how to make a mixed drink. I&#39;ve actually never sent a drink back in my life but my friend insisted and we switched to beers. <br><br>Don&#39;t worry . . . . it gets worse. I thought if the drinks were bad the food has to more than make up for it. Boy was I wrong. The best part honestly were the french fries. I like that they give you the option of sweet potato and regular both together. Although, they were actually a bit soggy. The sandwiches (which are hard to eff up) were both incredibly bland. Thin layers of prosciutto and mozz slapped on a dried out stale hunk of baguette with no flavor, no dressing. The steak sandwich he got since we swapped halves and I got to try both was equally as bad. Half of the portion of steak had chunks of inedible fat grizzle, again no sauce or flavor on a stale baguette. The best part of the entire meal were the mushrooms from the steak sandwich and my over-priced Brooklyn lager. Service was friendlier this time around.

Though some menus are a bit limited I&#39;m sure these something for everyone. <br><br>My first stop was 5 Napkin Burger on the upper west side. The restaurant menu option includes your choice out of 10 burger options , a drink and a side of crinkle, sweet potato or corn battered waffle fries for $21 dollars before tax.<br><br>I chose the Bacon Cheddar Burger with the Corn batter waffle fries and a lemonade as my drink. Here&#39;s a tip mention the restaurant week menu or you will pay full price as it not listed on there website or QR code ordering option. I also ordered the watermelon margarita because it was a hot day. <br><br>The drinks came first. The watermelon marg started off good but towards the middle all I could taste was salt so I didn&#39;t finish it. The food game out fresh and hot! The burger was cooked just how I liked it medium well and was juicy. Nobody likes a dry burger. I think my favorite part of the meal was the corn battered waffle dries. I&#39;ve never had it prepared like that and it was crispy and warm. Dare I say better than Chic Fil A fries. I would come back just for those because I couldn&#39;t get enough.<br><br>Definitely try this place out.

When the mimosa&#39;s arrived the glasses were dirty with a black smug mark, not even a finger print so that left me wondering what substance could have possibly touched the glass. <br><br>When my entree arrived i was a bit more impressed i would definitely give the meal a 10 for taste and presentation.
