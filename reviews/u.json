Undoubtedly, Leo&#39;s has been the king of the small block for years, but by no means overlook Underground Pizza. I had probably walked by Underground Pizza hundreds of times, but neglected it each time in search of something &#34;better&#34; to eat for lunch. After an unsuccessful trip to one of the food carts at Hanover Square, I FINALLY decided to give them a shot.<br><br>I knew they had a great variety of pizzas, so it was of no shock to me when I walked in and saw all of the different pies laid out. You name it and they have it - regular, pepperoni, buffalo chicken, spinach, white cheese, mushroom, grandma regular, grandma pepperoni, etc. In my first trip, I decided to go simple and went with a regular and pepperoni heated up.<br><br>To summarize, the slices were good. Unfortunately, they weren&#39;t hot anymore by the time I had reached my cubicle or my lunch time &#34;dining room&#34;. However, I am glad to report that the slices were perfect and really exactly the way I love my New York pizza slices. The slices were thin, but not extremely thin. With each bite and crunch, you knew there was crust there. There was ample cheese on each slice and just enough oil to wet your beak. I disdain when pizza slices have so much oil they can run an automobile and the amount of oil on the pizza here was just enough to keep the cheese moist.

A lot of the sauces didn&#39;t go well with the fish at all and were too tart or too salty or both. I was pretty shocked at how crass the flavors were for a price point that is fairly high end, and have had much better experiences at other places both above, at, and below the same price point as this place. Even the A5 Miyazaki wagyu was underwhelming, with a sauce that was too salty/vinegary which totally overwhelmed the taste of the meat, which is the whole point.

Paired with lemon, salt and pepper.<br><br>Mackerel- lightly salted and reminiscent of the sea, it was sweet, robust, succinctly mackerel finely slivered with scallions and topped w ginger.<br><br>Medium belly tuna- luscious, flavorful tender tuna we were instructed to dip in soy but really, it didn&#39;t need anything. <br><br>O-toro fatty tuna- top seared for flavor and textural difference with sea salt, the belly utterly melts unto our palette. The buttery oils released from the small servings were incredibly bountiful, flavorful and very delicious.<br><br>Goldeneye snapper- a touch of sear to the skin to bring out the flavor profile of a perfect fish. Almost if you crossed a cod with yellowtail, goldeneye imparts hearty richness with the translucent snap of a lighter, vibrant breed. <br><br>Ikura- delicate little bowls filled with the sweetest big eye fish roe swimming in dashi \u00a0mixture.

I called to book the sushi bar for omakase, and it wasn&#39;t too hard to get weekend reservation if you are okay with 6pm seating. <br><br>Everything was what I remembered - courteous services, modest interior design, authentic feel. We ordered all sushi omakase, which started off with green tea tofu and miso soup. I&#39;ve never had green tea tofu before, definitely something new. Miso soup is not overly salty, and it&#39;s enriched by a shrimp head. After that, the chef started putting in front of us rounds after rounds of amazing sushi. When it first started, rice was a little too hot, but maybe chef also realized that, after the first two, everything turned out to be just perfect. <br><br>Here are some highlights: <br>- Slightly tourched sea eel: so so tender. Not overly fatty, but it was so flavorful and soooo tender. \u00a0<br>- Japanese white shrimp: I though the texture would be chewy, but it literally melted in my mouth. <br>- Fried shrimp head: Japanese doesn&#39;t waste anything, so authentic places usually fry the shrimp heads after using the shrimp body for sushi. This shrimp head is perfectly fried, crunchy, flavorful, simple yet delicious. <br>- Medium tuna: I&#39;ve developed my liking for medium and lean tuna after eating at Sushi Nakazawa several times. It doesn&#39;t taste as fatty as toro, but it still melts in your mouth. What can I say, I LOVE tuna. <br>- Squid: I&#39;ve never had squid nigiri before, this was a first. It tasted like pickled squid, nothing too chewy but had some texture to it. <br>- Japanese Uni: do I need to say anything more about that? <br><br>So here&#39;s the verdict: rice was a little too warm at first, but they corrected it; light on soy comparing to some other sushi places. With price tag of $130 per person, we each had 18 pieces of amazing nigiri, including usual items such as amberjack, mackerel, tuna, uni, to a little more unconventional items like needlefish, squid, Japanese white shrimp.

You order, then pay the man who will both break your $20 bill and make the burger as you wait. It seems to come, by default, as a double patty cheeseburger. You can make it a combo by adding fries, but that&#39;s something I wouldn&#39;t recommend given the mismatched quality of the fries compared to the excellent burger. It&#39;s got Shake Shack vibes with two thin, medium cooked patties with melty American cheese and a delicious secret sauce. It comes on a routine hamburger bun that would look right at home on a grocery shelf in Anywhere, USA--but all-in-all the whole shebang is fabulous.

Both times were very crowded with one being in a group of 9 and the other with over 20. Loud spot with a lot of waitstaff. As it is a semi-nice spot and due to it&#39;s crowded nature, I&#39;d compare the food to an extent to Wu&#39;s Wonton though as of the last couple Wu meals, I prefer this spot, I prefer this restaurant as it was more consistent.<br><br>The first time we had the following:<br><br>Stuffed Eggplants in Black Bean Sauce: These were stuffed with shrimp and fish and they were tasty. Good black bean sauce<br><br>Peking Pork Chops: Sauce had a good light sweetness. Not as good as Wu&#39;s and definitely not as meaty but still solid and less fried by comparison.<br><br>Pea Shoots Saut\u00e9ed Fu Ru: Furu refers to red saut\u00e9ed fermented bean curd and it paired nicely with the pea shoots. Good version of this dish.<br><br>Dried Scallop &amp; Egg Fried Rice: Said fried rice also had raisins, bacon, and shrimp. The fried rice was OK. It was better than the cured meat fried rice we got the other time as it was better flavored.<br><br>Pan fried Lotus Root Pork Patties: Very moist with a good crisp. Not too fried with a good pork flavor. This was served with 6 bao which was a fun touch. Probably my favorite of the bunch<br><br>Crispy Garlic Chicken: Good amount of fried garlic. Moister compared to Wu&#39;s though I found both a bit bland.<br><br>Cauliflower + Oyster Mushroom in XO Sauce: Very tasty. Strong umami flavor from the mushrooms and well made. Probably my 2nd favorite.<br><br>Steam Whole Flounder: Cantonese style whole fish has never been my favorite as I find it a bit bland but it&#39;s always tender. Good of it&#39;s style.<br><br>The second time I was here was with a larger group with some repeaters. Again, we got the crispy garlic chicken (solid again,) the lotus root pork patties (still delicious,) and the Peking pork chops (still solid.) The other newer dishes were:<br><br>Homestyle Chenpi Duck With Mandarin Orange Sauce: Chenpi refers to dried mandarin orange peel and that gives a hint that this won&#39;t be too sweet. \u00a0The sauce had a wonderful mix of sweetness and bitterness. This is popular for a really good reason and was easily my favorite dish I have had here<br><br>Braised Pork Belly With Mui Choy: Very tender pork that could be cut with a spoon. Good portion size with plenty of the fermented vegetable. A bit salty but that&#39;s normal.<br><br>Saut\u00e9ed Pea Shoots With Garlic: Good garlic flavor and plenty of shoots. Very tasty version. Would recommend<br><br>Buddha&#39;s Delight: Plenty of things inside but as per usual for this vegetarian dish, it&#39;s just alright. Sauce was lighter than normal. Pretty good<br><br>Whole Peking Duck: Just OK. Skin could have been crispier and the meat could have been more moist. Just get the chenpi.<br><br>Fried Salt &amp; Pepper Flounder Filets: Standard version with a standard fry. Alright.<br><br>Cured Meat Fried Rice: Not enough lapcheong/other meat for the price. Just alright <br><br>The first time I went here, it was probably a low 4 and the second time was a mid 4. The chenpi duck and the lotus patties are my easy favorite here.

The General Tso chicken fat was overshadowed by excessive breading, while the jumbo shrimp failed to deliver on size and taste.<br><br>Starting with the General Tso chicken, I was disheartened to find that it was predominantly comprised of breading. It appeared that they took the chicken fat they clean from the chicken and coated it with breading and sauce. The chicken fat was overshadowed, leading to an imbalance of textures and flavors. This dish lacked the meaty bold and tangy taste I was anticipating resulting in leaving most of it untouched on the plate.<br><br>Equally disappointing was the Jumbo shrimp, which failed to live up to its name. The shrimp were far from jumbo in size, and their taste fell flat. I was expecting succulent and flavorful shrimp, but sadly, they left no lasting impression. The lack of seasoning or distinctive flavors made it a forgettable dish. <br><br>Overall, my experience at this Chinese restaurant left me with mixed feelings.

I like the set up of the place. It gets insanely crowded so I recommend coming at off hours. Which even though we did around 4pm there was still a 20 minute wait for a table for 4. If you&#39;re only two people, you might get off easier. We may have ordered the entire menu. No joke. I mostly went with the wontons in chili oil and the saucy beef chow ho fun noodle dish but tried a variety of other things. <br><br>The wonton in chili oil: Not what I was expecting with the consistency of the sauce. It&#39;s very runny and just full chili. Sometimes I like a little bit of a sesame or peanut taste. Pleasant surprise was that there was a shrimp inside of each. Reminders this is actually Cantonese food and not Sichuan or Shanghai. But I couldn&#39;t honestly tell you the absolute differences with each. <br><br>Steamed Vegetable Dumplings: Definitely the most disappointing thing we ordered. Very bland and filled with glass jelly noodles amongst other greens. I liked the consistency of the dumpling dough though. Just not the filling.<br><br>Eggplant in Yuxiang Garlic Sauce: Surprisingly pretty tasty. This might have been the star side dish that I guess is an entree. The sauce is nice and the eggplant almost has this caramelized texture and taste. <br><br>Baby Bok Choy with Garlic: I honestly would never order an entire bowl of bok choy. But it&#39;s a nice accompaniment and mixed in with other things adds freshness and brightness. <br><br>Half a duck: Again, I liked the sauce. I&#39;m a huge fan of duck. Huge. HUGE. But it wasn&#39;t the best duck I&#39;ve ever had. It was just very okay. I wouldn&#39;t splurge the price tag over it.<br><br>Twice Cooked Pork: Almost sent the dish back because there was just too much food ordered. I personally thought it was fine. That was it. It was very fatty meat. Didn&#39;t try the accompanying veggies with it.<br><br>Saucy Beef Chow Ho Fun: We ordered both unsauced and sauced because me and my partner wanted to get the same thing and he doesn&#39;t like sharing lol. But I will say, go with the sauced noodles. It&#39;s richer and fuller and comes with significant more of a balance of vegetables. Going to be honest, I thought the thing I ordered was the best thing I ate here and glad I went the noodle route while sampling a few other dishes.

We got the S&#39;more&#39;s cone (made with a Dandies vegan marshmallow) and the \u00a0Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel, which I liked more than the S&#39;more&#39;s (I think it could have used some chocolate sauce). So we switched. But they were both really tasty.<br><br>There&#39;s not much room inside the UDL; they also limit the number of guests inside, I guess to keep it from getting too warm. There is, however, seating outside so you can sit and enjoy your cone. Oh, and did I mention they use waffle cones? It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen vegan waffle cones, so I couldn&#39;t be more thrilled. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely have to come back the next time I&#39;m in New York.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 82, "reviewCount": 146, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "8/4/2023", "comment": {"text": "This place was definitely not for me but I seem to be an outlier here.

The toppings were okay and they did put some on the bottom of the cup so each bite had toppings which is probably the only thing I liked here.

The staff are all incredibly friendly, and service is excellent. The atmosphere is really nice, but still casual. The wine list is also phenomenal! Oh, and the food is obviously delicious.<br><br>Now, for the pizza. Yes, it&#39;s great. Is it worthy of being the best pizza in the country at the moment? Maybe, maybe not...at least for us. There are incredible elements, like the cornicione, which is so airy, has good char and chew. The texture, in short, is unreal. The sauce on the Margherita is incredible. There&#39;s a slight sweetness that would make you think he&#39;s added a sugar element, but I highly doubt it. There&#39;s just something excellent and standout about the sauce that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve had in a traditional San Marzano sauce. We&#39;ve tried many without getting THAT flavor! I also love the mozzarella he&#39;s using. I prefer a mozz on my Neapolitan pie that holds this texture and isn&#39;t too melty or runny. All high points. <br><br>Now, as super picky pizza folks, there were some things we didn&#39;t necessarily think matched our expectations for THE top spot in the country. For a naturally-leavened dough, we tasted almost zero of the sourdough flavor we expected to find. Any subtle sourness I worry was from me searching so hard that I&#39;ve made it up. We eat a ton of Neapolitan pizza (and make a ton of naturally-leavened Neapolitan) and I&#39;m not sure there was much difference in flavor from some 2 or 3-day fermentation commercial yeast doughs. It&#39;s flavorful, just not as flavorful as we expected. Picky, I know. While the cornicione is texturally amazing, there&#39;s the issue of too much not always being better. The larger crust makes it photo-worthy, sure, but we are rarely so full from two pies. This dough absolutely crushed us like it&#39;s 300g of dough or something. Another downside of such a showcasing of the dough means the toppings on the special pie I had were overwhelmed. The sauce on the Margherita kept the ratio feeling better, but the dryer special just couldn&#39;t stand up to the dough. So, while the pizza IS amazing, being #1 means we have to examine things at a different level. The cornicione texture is probably unmatched, but in the flavor of the dough, and dough-to-toppings ratio areas, it&#39;s definitely debatable for us.<br><br>Another downside is the cost. Coming from Philly, we expect to feel a NYC cost adjustment, but at $25 for a Margherita, we&#39;re talking nearly between 66-92% increase compared to our typical Neapolitan spots. Una is DEFINITELY worth checking out, but even for freewheeling food spenders like us, there&#39;s a slight price barrier to wanting to rush back. I certainly will return, though.<br><br>So ultimately, we were happy we went, and it was a truly enjoyable experience. The fact that we left feeling a little underwhelmed stems mostly from us taking pizza far too seriously, and from grading Una on a #1-pizza-in-the-country curve. It&#39;s legit. It&#39;s great. It&#39;s beautiful. It&#39;s a lot of things. I just can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s #1 for us.

My guess is that @anthony_w_mangieri wants you to eat the pizza as he intended, or the only EVOO they use is too expensive to give out by request.

Should have known why there is so little demand. It&#39;s terrible. Oyster selection is ok. \u00a0I had a selection of 4 and the clams. Briny but their accompanying sauces lacked the finnese I usually look for (eg the horseradish is flavorless and packs none of the heat it should). Then I had the burrata with crab ravioli and the squid ink pasta with uni. First, the Burrata with crab ravioli came out within a few min of ordering. The pasta on the crab ravioli was cold, hard... it was gross, like eating uncooked ravioli straight out of the freezer. <br><br>Then the squid ink uni. The uni was brown, slimy, and not fresh, none of the sweet delicate taste I was looking for. This place touts itself on not having a freezer but maybe they should have one to keep their seafood fresher and sell better food over a gimmick. The pasta sauce was too sour, which was unpleasant. All around inedible. <br><br>Additionally, the service was dismissive and inattentive. I sat for a while before anyone came to fill my water or take my order. Waitress never came to check in on me and hardly spoke 10 words to me. After telling me he&#39;d get me a fresh plate after the oysters and Burrata appetizer, the busser never came so I just used my small plate the whole time, with the uneaten frozen ravioli still there. <br><br>Also, like caught Mahi mahi from Hawaii?

Too much pasta and the clams came on too so I had to manually separate the clams from the shells and by the time you get a bite together of some pasta, a piece of clam and some sauce, you&#39;ve already made a mess of the plate and the foods cooled off.

Good food always makes my heart and stomach happy. \u00a0And my bestie and I have kept up that tradition well where we stumble on a non-fancy hole-in-the-wall but the food surpasses our expectations. \u00a0That was the impression left on me at this place.

Not a problem. The friendly hostess said I had a choice of tables so I took a seat in front. I could look out the window to people watch but there was also garbage out there so I switched seats to look at all the couples and throuples and pals having a great time. It&#39;s a narrow, small, and perfectly-dimly lit place with seats at the bar, high top tables, and \u00a0regular tables for 2 or 4. I didn&#39;t check out the outdoor seating but there was a lot of service going outside. I got down to business to select my oysters (1/2 dozen) and a craft brew. Not an IPA guy, So I got a lager that was good but I should&#39;ve gotten the Pilsner--which I did get on round two.<br>My wait person was friendly and helpful when I asked a few questions about the menu. There was a special that sounded good, but I already knew what I wanted. Along with the oysters, I ordered their in-house cured salmon I had read about in other reviews and crab cakes. <br>The crab cakes: 2, served on greens with some vinaigrette. I don&#39;t get crab cakes too often so I can&#39;t compare. The balance of crab to cake ratio (I know, I mean breadcrumbs?) and seasoning was great. I didn&#39;t see/don&#39;t remember if there was an aioli but it really didn&#39;t need it.<br>The salmon portion was very generous- mounds of large but not thick slices, with red onion and capers and nicely toasted bread all plated on a slate with what I think was XVOO. I have a good appetite but the idea of having an entree after that was too much.<br>I enjoy smoked salmon a few times a year, but usually on a bagel, or out of a package at home. This is not your ordinary grocery store or IKEA salmon. It&#39;s insulting to even mention the big box salmon in the same review as this but that&#39;s my go to for salmon at home. <br>Delicious, delicate, tender but very salty. It&#39;s salt cured so that makes sense. Needed extra bread that seemed to be like asking for ketchup with a steak. I&#39;m not ketoing, but I don&#39;t usually raid the bread basket when I go out to eat. But in this case, I needed the extra carbs as a vehicle to finish up the salmon. It was too good to not finish but it was way too much for one person.<br>So far so great. The exception came when I found out no dessert menu and no coffee. In hindsight, I realize coffee makes people linger and such a small place needs to turn the tables. <br>My wait person suggested pound cake with a drizzle of whiskey and I think I asked about brown liquor to drink. I want to say he said they have an in-house whiskey, but not sure exactly how he phrased it. Whatever it was, I ordered a short one finger pour. I don&#39;t remember how it happened but when I got the pound cake (with a drizzle of whiskey) and the glass of whiskey, tried both, I didn&#39;t even think about having a coffee.<br>Whatever that whiskey is/was was smooth, slightly sweet. Nice.<br>I decided I would come back just for that. <br>I felt alittle guilty about not ordering an entree but when I added up the three plates and two beers I think it was comparable. I didn&#39;t want to stay too long so I asked for the check.<br>It looked like I had been comped a couple of things. Which was a surprise and very nice.<br>Left a 30% tip on what I was charged. <br>Why not 5 stars? Well, it&#39;s not their fault, exactly, but one of the nearby tables (all the tables are very close to each other) had 4 young women who got louder and louder to the point of shrieking /screaming laughter. I don&#39;t know if it was because they were imbibing, but it disturbed me. I was going to say something but it was a temporary inconvenience so I just decided it&#39;s a busy night, they were young and having fun. When I dine solo I don&#39;t talk, obviously, so I notice when the din starts to get louder. There&#39;s a point where people tend to shout to be heard. That&#39;s when I&#39;m done. <br>So, beer selection is great, especially if you like IPAs. Oyster selection was ample but not overwhelming. All the food was very good, fresh, flavorful and lots of it. The pound cake and whiskey were great. Staff was friendly, helpful, quick, but I never felt rushed.

The crust here was quite crispy &amp; airy, the right texture of a classic New York slice &amp; as I said, it was clear the bread was given a good proper rise with how bubbly this slice was. The flavor combos on the slice were fantastic, with the cherry tomatoes offering a burst of sweet juicy flavor to balance the creamy &amp; smoky chipotle sauce. The chicken tasted good, but it was quite dry which was a little disappointing &amp; was tough to chew through in that regard.

He was helpful and answered all of our questions. I loved that you can tell her had passion for the pizza! <br>The food was delicious and authentic! I had a calzone (not my first time in NYC so I didn&#39;t order pizza lol) and man, it was packed with chicken! I wanted something with protein as I haven&#39;t been eating much protein for a week (vacation makes you eat unhealthy) and I chose just that because of it. The calzone wasnt heavy on the dough like some joints do, this one was proportioned and balanced between dough, sauce, cheese and chicken! Ok, maybe too much chicken but who complains on extra meat?! Lmao no one!! The pizza was ravedby my parents the whole time and my brother even said NY has the best pizza ever! Of course, every pizza is unique but you know what he meant, it was delicious and worth it! <br>Given the interior and dining room and how up kept the bathroom and outdoor dining is, the pizza is worth the money and amazingly not expensive. The price is so worth the quality and quantity!! Attention to detail is here and I would definitely come back to enjoy this local eatery.

As far as I can tell, it is always the one same dude operating the vehicle. During lunch, there can be pretty long lines, so keep that in mind. Columbia&#39;s block schedule for noon time ends at 11:55, so expect TONS of people to start showing up right around 12.

However, once you place your order, unless you order something complex, you should get your food in under a minute.<br><br>No cooking is done on board- I think all of it is done in their restaurant, which is actually located pretty nearby (106 and amsterdam), then brought over to the food truck via another vehicle. So, yes, the food isn&#39;t exactly its freshest the later in the day you get, but at the very least it&#39;s kept pretty hot. As for the food... for a safe bet, get the $7 rice box with tomato and egg, beef, and string beans. There are many other options here but until you start going several times and get a close look at some of the options yourself, don&#39;t order anything too wild. I also think the salt and pepper fish is quite good, in case you don&#39;t eat beef. I would also advise against the pork bun/burger. It&#39;s fairly filling and pretty affordable, but has very little taste, for some reason.<br><br>Something important to note: these people don&#39;t have fixed hours, but generally the truck will start closing down at about 7 oclock (as per my conversation with the staff). However, they might close earlier on some days, sometimes perhaps simply if they feel like it? One of the reasons this place closes early is because they&#39;ll sell out of food on any given day, and this can happen even as early as lunch time, with regards to certain items anyway.

This is the perfect solo dining meal, but also worthy of a date who is okay with close quarter eating.<br><br>The food was always inconsistent over the years, but I find they&#39;ve gotten better through the pandemic. I have always been a sucker for the nabeyaki udon + tempura combo, which comes with a side a bowl of rice. The soft udon noodles make for a nice contrast to the crunch of the assorted tempura. Their chige udon is a nice play between Korean stews (chigae) and udon and contains a good flavor&#39;y mix of beef, kimchi, egg, and spinach. I also think the karaage (fried chicken) and maru-ten (fish cake + tempura) udon are worthy of consideration.<br><br>Then there are the standout dishes that aren&#39;t udon based at all, which is where I give them the additional thumbs up. Their curry sets (croquette or cutlet) are super tasty and I am a big time sucker for their negi-tori don (fatty tuna over rice); which is so good I wish there was more of it. The gyoza and takoyaki (octopus balls) are solid, but certainly don&#39;t trump the main dishes whatsoever.<br><br>Last I checked, they were cash only. Indoor dining service has resumed so that it&#39;s not exclusively a takeout joint. Service is friendly and they don&#39;t rush folks even when there is a wait. I would avoid bringing large groups of any kind here and would recommend ordering both a rice and noodle bowl for the best of both worlds. <br><br>____________<br>(#1) R.I.P.

The candied pecans are amazing with it. <br><br>-Tuna Crudo: perfect for sharing - comes with 6 pieces.

Honestly, probably not worth the money because there really wasn&#39;t much flavor but it&#39;s a fun dish.

We decided to just kinda order a bunch of different stuff off the menu and just share everything...too many things on the menu that we all wanted a taste of lol. <br><br>The service/servers were very attentive at first and through most of the meal (especially when trying to figure out how many total dishes would be a good amount for our group to share, which was a little tricky with dish sizes [apps, pastas, entrees, etc.]), though a bit of a wait to get a hold of somebody when we were trying to close on out - but overall pretty good. And onto the food:<br><br>Roasted Squash appetizer (I don&#39;t 100% recall the proper name of the dish and looks to have just dropped from the [online] menu) with tahini, pine nuts, and other goodness - I&#39;m normally a &#39;must have a protein&#39; dish orderer-kinda guy, but this was divine!<br><br>Duck Liver Mousse with Rhubarb, Green Apple, Pickled Mustard Seed - creamy, decadent, and indulgent; love the idea of the pickled mustard seed and green apple to contrast with the richness of the mousse. Delightful.<br><br>Spicy Manilla Clams with Soppressata, Shallot, Chili - these were perfectly fine, and tasty, but perhaps 100% necessary / maybe should have been more adventurous with a more unique dish.<br><br>Mafaldine All&#39;anatra (with Duck Ragu, Pistachio, Amaro) - You had me at duck ragu and pistachios. Loooved this dish (and was pulling hard for it during the deliberation process lol). The flavors of the ragu meets pistachios worked so well, perfectly cooked pasta - yum!<br><br>Ricotta Cavatelli (with Kale Pesto, Market Broccoli, Ricotta Salata Vecchio) - very nice, the kale pesto really shined; we really enjoyed this one.<br><br>Fettuccine al Limone (Preserved Lemon, Breadcrumb) - this dish was surprisingly delicious; I&#39;m always a bit hesitant to order dishes that feature lemon as it seems to be frequently over-done/overpowering, but this was just spot on!<br><br>Arctic Char - really superb!<br><br>Half Chicken Scarpariello with Pork Sausage, Pickled Peppers, Charred Lemon - I&#39;m not one to order chicken when dining out, but this...this was good. Crispy skin, really hearty dish (and we were dining in mid February, so very timely).<br><br>Roasted Duck Breast with Moroccan Carrots, Purple Barley, Charred Almonds - overall the dish was delightful, from the duck itself (whiiiich...I could always wish for more) to the complimenting sides/garnish, really tasty.<br><br>Side of Roasted Brussel Spouts - if brussels are on the menu, I&#39;m asking for &#39;em. And the table thanked me lol.<br><br>In the spirit of gluttony, we also opted for 2 desserts, which they actually added candles to as it happened to be close to two of our birthdays. I settled on the:<br><br>Burnt Honey Cheesecake with Whipped Chevre, Bruleed Figs, Red Wine Sauce - a really cool brulee twist to a cheesecake, glad we land on this one!<br><br>Chocolate Panna Cotta with Cocoa Tuile, Malted Whipped Cream - a chocolate lover&#39;s dream.<br><br>All in all, very pleased with our outing at this NYC institution!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 1, "reviewCount": 11, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "10/2/2023", "comment": {"text": "Went for brunch.

First of all, it&#39;s really pretty inside- not at all what comes to mind when you hear &#34;cafe&#34;; it&#39;s more upscale but still comfortable and inviting. There were some beautiful spring flower displays with cherry blossoms when we visited for dinner on Easter weekend. Service was excellent. The servers were very attentive and were constantly refilling our waters, looking over at our table- basically anticipating what we might need. We were a party of 4 eating dinner. The other members of my party had all eaten here before but this was my first time visiting. We decided to start with a few appetizers for the table. My family had all raved about the broccoli, which seems like such an odd thing to be impressed with.... But, let me say this. Just order it! I don&#39;t know what they do to it but it was honestly addictive and crave-able. We&#39;d also ordered a Bibb salad, which was tasty as well but ended up ordering a second order of the broccoli after we devoured the first one. I honestly need to know the recipe. They were able to accommodate my nut allergy by serving the pecans on the side. For my entree, I ordered the half chicken. It was served with a light gravy type sauce with some pieces of sausage and some peppers underneath. The bits of sausage gave it a thanksgiving turkey and stuffing vibe, but more elevated. Two other members of my group also got the chicken because they&#39;d had it before. We ordered some fingerling potatoes as a side. That was the only item that I didn&#39;t really feel was above and beyond. They weren&#39;t bad, just nothing special. They did go nicely with the chicken, if you want some carbs. My mom got fettuccine al limone and the pasta was cooked perfectly with a zesty creamy lemon sauce. It comes as a small portion or for $10 more, you can have the pastas as an entree portion, which they said is double the size. She got the entree size and it wasn&#39;t huge. It was just right for the main dish of her meal. The other two member of my party also got the chicken. Everyone&#39;s was cooked perfectly and it was such a large portion. We also got some desserts for the table and coffee. The coffees came with a little biscotti. We chose the tiramisu, the chocolate cake, and the strawberry &#34;panzanella&#34;. I&#39;m not a fan of tiramisu but this one was delicious. Very well balanced and so creamy and chocolatey. The cake was rich and had a great deep flavor. My favorite turned out to be the strawberry dessert! I&#39;m a huge chocolate fan so that surprised me. It had a basil cake with strawberry gelato and whipped mascarpone. There were some crisps on top as well. So many textures! Our server stopped back by the table just to let me know none of our desserts had nuts.

The noise/crowd was boisterous but not terrible. Waiter quickly came to take our water/drink order. Then another wait person quickly checked in \u00a0to see if we were ready to order. We hadn&#39;t even looked at our menus but promised we would. Minutes later, first waiter returned with our drinks and pressed us to take our order again but we had literally just told the other wait person we needed a few minutes. He apologized and left. Literally as he disappeared, the 2nd wait person returned, full-court-press, for our order which we figured out and gave to her just to get them off our backs so we could proceed with our catch up.

Crickets for almost 45 minutes before I finally stopped a passing bus person and asked to send our waiter over. The lunch rush had subsided by then, and the restaurant was emptying out. The 2nd wait person (who took our order) returned and I asked where our food was. She said something about hold-ups in the kitchen... but for real? I asked what the hurry-up to order was all about if the kitchen was ill-prepared to turn around our food.<br><br>Needless to say (and in this age of living and dying on Yelp and social media reviews) the manager (I assumed the never-before-seen guy) suddenly appeared at our table pouring water and asking if we needed anything when our salads were finally delivered to our table. I did request fresh ground pepper, and moments later a small ramekin containing what appeared to be store-bought pre-ground pepper was presented to our table. I asked if they had an actual pepper grinder, but the manager said they &#34;Vitamix grind&#34; their pepper. Ok... Interesting.<br><br>When we finished eating, said wait person suddenly appeared again and thumped a couple of clean dessert plates on our table and asked if we wanted anything sweet, to which we declined. Yet, the restaurant wasn&#39;t having any of that. Suddenly two desserts (cheesecake and ice cream) were \u00a0foisted onto our table as they were &#34;on the house&#34;, but we vociferously declined and thanked them anyway for the gesture.

The table of 2 next to us was seated ~20 minutes after us with the same waiter and the waiter was much more attentive. It was as though the kitchen lost our order. The table next to use ordered a while after us but got their food much faster. We actually saw the hostess pull the waiter aside to remind him that we were his table. From a food perspective, the menu is limited for GF options, which is not surprising for an Italian restaurant. Despite no indication on the menu, they do have GF pasta. The pork shank was OK. All the pasta was over salted. Overall, I&#39;d say Ulivo is not worth going out of your way for.

We decided to be adventurous and got the special pasta of the night, which is the rigatoni with braised short ribs and one off of their menu, the malloreddus alla campidanese. Both pasta were amazing and tried both pasta. We liked the malloreddus more at first, but later we agreed that the rigatoni was the winner. The rigatoni pasta tasted like no other pasta I had before. It has a subtle buttery taste to it, but did not overpowered the meat. The more you eat it, the more it will grow on you, like you don&#39;t want it to end. Meat sauce was delicious, well-seasoned and pasta is made in-house, so amazingly firm, thick, and chewy. The malloreddus pasta isn&#39;t made in-house, but still pretty al dente. It comes with a sweet and spicy sausage ragu. The meat sauce once again was phenomenal, hearty and meaty just how I like it. Only downside is I wished both pasta dishes were more saucier, then it would be perfect. I always like to dip my bread into the meat sauce at the end of my meal. By the way, their complimentary bread was not impressive at all, pretty hard and stale. <br><br>Ambiance: 4.75/5 - Amazing ambiance for a date night or catching up with friends, both romantic and inviting feel with soft lightings and pretty decor. Definitely have one of the better date night vibes compared to other Italian restaurants. We sat in the corner booth, so the atmosphere was super cute and relaxing, able to see the whole restaurant in action and the cocktail bar too near the entrance. We came in on a weekday for dinner, inside was pretty empty and quiet, so no need to worry about distancing, and able to have a good conversation with your group. \u00a0<br><br>Price: 4.5/5 - We got two glasses of red wine at $14 per glass and two pasta as entrees, the total came up to be around $80 before tips and tax. For the price and portion, I think Ulivo really stands out, especially for a Michelin Guide restaurant, a good value and steal for all the pasta lover out there. <br><br>Service: 4.5/5 - Our waitress was great. She recommended us some red wine selection and pasta, and then explained to us where its from in Italy thoroughly, super informative. I would say the service matches with the food, perfect and outstanding. Also, the Italian charm and authenticity were not missed on us. We really enjoyed the experience. <br><br>BLUF: 100% would recommend this place. Shockingly good pasta, great and extensive selection of wine menu, awesome customer service.

There were about a dozen or so people eating and standing around inside the small establishment, which made it feel very crowded. That said, there was no wait to order. I saw the Burrapizza Cafonata staring back at me from the center of the case. The huge dollop of burrata looking at me like a giant eyeball. It looked amazing, but would it taste as good as it looked? The person who took my order popped it in the oven, and it came out piping hot. I found an inch or two at the chest-high counter and began to eat my slice of heaven. The flavor was exceptional. I&#39;m a sucker for sweet and spicy. The pepperoni cups were delicious. \u00a0The slice had the right amount of heat.

We came across this place in our search and decided to try it. Immediately we were greeted by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. We ordered the Thai iced tea and the Lychee Thai iced tea. Both were masterfully made and tasted amazing. The Thai iced tea was a little different than what we&#39;ve had at other places, but we both agreed it was the best one we&#39;ve tried yet. It had lots of flavor and wasn&#39;t too sweet. The Lychee Thai iced tea was very refreshing and slightly sweet but perfectly balanced. <br><br>For appetizers we got the Mango Salad, Pork Dumplings, and Steak Empanada. The Mango Salad was absolutely delicious. A little spicy, but the mix of flavors and textures really made it stand out. The Pork Dumplings were super flavorful and cooked to perfection. Lastly, the Steak Empanada is what really threw us off; it was phenomenal. I can&#39;t explain the flavor used in it, but it was something neither of us ever had before. It&#39;s almost like a licorice flavor that&#39;s present, mixed with everything else. Normally I&#39;m put off by anything of the sort, but it worked so well. It was also equally cooked to perfection; crispy and flakey where it counts. You only get one, but the size of it is more than enough for an appetizer.<br><br>For entrees we got the Tiger Cry (medium rare) and the Spicy Eggplant Basil with Tofu (we added chicken). These dishes were incredible. The Tiger Cry was cooked perfectly to medium rare, and was full of so much flavor. The portion was also very generous especially considering the cost. The rice and vegetables were a bit plain, but I prefer that so that I can blend them with the steak.<br><br>The Spicy Eggplant Basil with Tofu and Chicken was also packed of flavor, although not as spicy as we expected.

You&#39;d usually expect a restaurant named Unique Fusion in the middle of nowhere to not be that good but the ratings were super high so we decided to make the schlep there. They have some fun options (Thai empanada anyone) and the service was friendly. It&#39;s a casual spot and overall the food was excellent though the appetizers were better than the entrees. I had a lychee iced tea which wasn&#39;t overly sweetened and it was pretty tasty.<br><br>We first got the Mango Salad with sliced mango, red onions, tomato, Thai chili, roasted cashew, cilantro, garlic, fresh lime juice, and fish sauce. Excellent version with a good amount of heat especially towards the bottom. I&#39;d like it maybe slightly hotter with more spots but then again it&#39;s not an Isan spot so it&#39;s this style and it&#39;s definitely a good version.<br><br>We also got as an appetizer two of the dishes from the empanada section. My preference of the two was the Flank Steak Empanda consisting of grilled marinated flank steak with onions, garlic, and basil and with a Thai-style pickled salad and aioli. The mead inside was tender and very well flavored and as noted by others there was a unique spice. I presume there was star anise judging by the slight licorice flavor but there was definitely curry powder and some other stuff in there. Very tasty.<br><br>The Half Moon Turnover consisted of curried chicken, onion, potato, and oyster sauce wrapped in an oversized paratha and just like the other one it was served with a Thai-style pickled salad. This was essentially a giant version of a curry puff with a thicker crust and a lot more filling of course as it was so big. Also very tasty though less unique.<br><br>We got a bunch of dishes from the entree sections. Most of the main dishes are served with jasmine rice with some exceptions and I would say that they all had some faults.<br><br>The Slow Cooked Pork Shoulder with onions, garlic, and pineapple was likely my favorite. The pork was super tender with a rich flavor and the pineapple added some good tartness. There was also a bit of sweetness in the dish with my only potential complaint being that I found it a bit wet/ I wouldn&#39;t have minded the au jus being thicker but that&#39;s really only minor. <br><br>My other favorite was the Salmon Green Curry consisting of a reasonably sized piece of grilled salmon served in green curry with bell pepper (which we substituted for string beans,) eggplant, and basil. Usually I have a bit of trepidation with Thai curries served with bell peppers as this isn&#39;t traditional and usually a sign of an American Thai spot but the curry here was very solid. Well flavored with some spice and not too sweet.<br><br>The Pad See Ew with chicken Thai rice noodles, egg, and Chinese (or regular) broccoli in a sweet soy sauce was pretty good. Solid noodle texture and pretty tender chicken. This was the third best of the mains and it was fine.<br><br>OK was the Thai Beef Stew with celery, carrots, onions, mushroom and Thai basil. Just like the pork shoulder, the beef was very tender what&#39;s a good texture but there was way too much of some spice in it almost overpoweringly so. I&#39;m pretty positive it was cloves but I&#39;m not sure. Otherwise tasty especially if they were to reduce the amount of whatever that spice was (or I don&#39;t know let&#39;s say that as a Thai Clove Beef Stew.)<br><br>The Crispy Chicken Over Rice consisting of breaded chicken tenders with sweet chili sauce served with sliced cucumber and ginger rice most likely the weakest of the dishes. The chicken was a little bit bland and the breading was too heavy. The sweet chili sauce helped but not too much.<br><br>For desserts we got the Mango With Sticky Rice and Lemon Tart. The former was the standard with good quality mango and not super sweet rice. The lemon tart had a good sourness though I would say the crust was a bit thick. Still both were tasty and I would get both again and they were both reasonably priced.<br><br>Overall the food was good. If this was in a different neighborhood, I would probably give them a mid 3 saying that there were a bit too many faults especially with the entrees but the appetizers are very good but because it&#39;s this neighborhood and because of the more unique offerings which all happened to work, a low 4 is accurate for me.

Mouth melting in flavor. <br><br>Spicy Tuna Roll (4/5): I like the little cucumber added to this for an added crunch. The mixture of spicy and tuna is okay -- not really spicy at all. If I order this again I&#39;d ask for extra spicy for a little more bite. <br><br>Sakana San Shu Roll (4/5): For this price it was an steal to get 3 fish in here.

The breading is light and perfectly coated. <br><br>Miso Soup (4/5): Standard miso soup. Good simple flavor but darker than other miso soup and I actually like this one more. I think with scallion green onion this would be a 5/5.<br><br>Wasabi (1/5): If you&#39;re going to call out the wasabi it was either really good or really bad.

I will say my waiter tonight has always come with a smile and enthusiasm and even if we haven&#39;t chatted as much, I appreciate it even more. On my way in and back to the bathroom, the staff is always very courteous and always with a smile, a real one, not like in other places.<br><br>THE BEST<br>Try the mac and cheese, I had the salmon last time and the flavor and texture were on point. In a blind taste, I would challenge anyone to try this &#34;cheese&#34; dish and find out it&#39;s actually plant-based. The drinks... Perhaps was tonight&#39;s bartender but the drinks (The first, I ordered with Patron, and the second one with Don Julio) were kind of the weaker side, if I were you skip the cocktails and order wine or beer (Haven&#39;t had those myself but I reckon its a safer bet since bypasses the bartender) but by no means bad, just average you know?

The service was fine and appeared pretty impatient with another group who came in. The food here was alright and the ambiance was well a coffee shop. I&#39;m not exactly sure why the average here is so high but this is also the neighborhood where Old Tblisi Garden is very high rated so I digress (then again that spot is better than this one which isn&#39;t saying much.) To drink I had a glass of one of the Kvevri/Qvevri. Kvevri refers to an ancient Georgian preparation of usually orange/skin contact wine and I tend to like the majority as they tend to have some minerality.<br><br>From the Appetizers &amp; Salads section, we got a few dishes.<br><br>The Georgian Salad With Walnuts had tomato &amp; cucumber salad, fresh herbs, walnuts, and homemade cheese sulguni and it was $12. The walnut sauce here was lighter than most other spots not having nearly as much garlic and it seemed sparse. The portion size was decent but I found the flavors bland and it was still one of the better dishes.<br><br>The Beet Salad With Goat Cheese with marinated beets with raspberry cilantro sauce served on a corn bread topped with goat cheese for $14 was also alright. The presentation was nice and the goat cheese was fresh with there also being a lot of beets. The dressing was a tad sweet and I didn&#39;t mind that it was sparse. The flavors were fine but it was just from the mix and not from preparation.<br><br>When in a Georgian spot, you order baked goods and that&#39;s usually Khachapuri and for most people that is the Adjaruli variant. Our host ordered the traditional version ($14) as well as one with spinach (which is a buck more.) Both refer to a boat shaped pie with blended cheese and a raw egg with some butter you mix it all together while the cheese is hot. The cheese is a mix of sulguni and imeruli and as per usual it is a delicious salty dish. It was a bit small but well flavored but I heavily prefer the one at the pretty close Cafedelia. The spinach one was decent.<br><br>We got a couple main dishes. My favorite of the bunch by a mile was the Veal Chakapuli for $17 consisting of organic, grass-fed veal slow cooked with tarragon, sour plum, scallions, parsley, cilantro, and white wine. The meat inside was tender and there was plenty of it with a good soup base as well. I always like the sourness of this dish and this one didn&#39;t disappoint.<br><br>The Khinkali are the Georgian equivalent of soup dumplings and there&#39;s a minimum of three orders (with each order being $3.50 available with either meat or cheese. As per the other dishes, this was alright and a bit bland. I found the filling more sparse and the meat wasn&#39;t as well flavored and the dough was a bit too thick even for this dish.<br><br>Our final dish was the worst of the bunch. The Quail with Berry Sauce for $18 consisted of a single pan-fried quail with an alright sauce which I think was blackberry based. The sauce was decent and the accompanying salad was nice but the quail was very dry being overcooked and was tiny. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it at all being smaller than most of the appetizers and just not prepared well. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if it was an off night or something but I disagree with virtually every review here. I love Georgian food and there are plenty good Georgian spots in the city but almost nothing here was good outside of the Chakapuli. Everything was either overcooked or bland.

So it was my first experience eating Georgian food. Tried four dishes: Georgian salad with walnuts, Adjaruli khachapuri with mint, Shkmeruli, and Khinkali. The salad used peanut-sauce-like dressing, tasted okay but super refreshing, love the grape pieces. The star for us was the Adjaruli khachapuri, the cheese boat bread. Basically, we teared the bread and dipped it in its cheese-egg mixture. The texture of the bread was amazing, it had this medium crusty texture on the outside and very soft in the inside. When we combined it with the creamy cheese-egg mixture, it tasted just amazing, cheesey and subtle savory hint. It was good to enjoy while still warm. Next, Shkmeruli was chicken cooked in this creamy broth with lots of minced garlic, I mean really a lot, so it had a very strong garlic flavor. The broth was so creamy and buttery. We tried dipping the bread from Adjaruli to the creamy broth, and it was good!! The last dish, Khinkali is basically a giant Georgian dumpling, came 3 in one portion, they were hugeee. The skin was thick (it supposed to be thick anw) which we don&#39;t really like in general. The way to eat the dumpling is by flipping it upside down (so it would look like mushroom tree) and bite a bit part of the skin to suck the liquid/broth inside (it was hot so be careful to not burn the tongue) - reminded me of that xia long bao. There was this minced meat like meatball inside along with the broth. This dish was our least favorite in term of taste and texture. Overall, a quite good experience. Cheese boat bread was the best!

When we got there, the tall bearded guy (ironically the same exact employee that rang us up before) said phoned orders do not count, and made a point to say that it has *always* been this policy. Well, clearly NOT if you have done differently before. Everyone makes mistakes, but he still charged us $28 full price for the slices even though it wasn&#39;t 4 o&#39;clock yet (so technically, we could have cancelled the phone order and just re-ordered in person...).

We couldn&#39;t stomach eating the pizza after that (and our classmates were in disbelief that Tony&#39;s would insist on charging full price) so they did give us a full refund and threw the pizza in the trash.

My favorite is still their Talay Thai (Mixed Sea Food) curry. Even as take out, the curry is super aromatic and well-seasoned with a nice strong basil flavor.

The Goong Muk Kaikem, one of their seasonal specials, features shrimp and calamari along with bell peppers and onions in a duck egg yolk sauce. Not sure if I&#39;d call it a duck egg yolk sauce but it tasted more like a sweet soy sauce and basil based sauce with salted egg yolk pieces sprinkled on top. While it was very tasty, I wish it had more salted egg yolk flavors in it. The shrimp from this dish was a little overcooked but the veggies were good and soaked up the yummy sauce. Got another chance to try their khao soi which is a northern noodle dish. It wasn&#39;t a recommended dish (with the thumbs up sign) but I still wanted to try it cause I love khao soi noodles in general.

It&#39;s not the first time the order has been overcooked but this time, one order was literally black on both sides of the bread. I told her that we couldn&#39;t eat the food that was \u00a0delivered and she agreed to call and ask for a replacement.<br>As she described the condition of the food that was delivered, \u00a0I heard the person from the restaurant say &#34;You are always complaining about something, I will send another order this last time and don&#39;t order from us again.&#34; \u00a0My wife looked shocked and asked, &#34;What did we complain about last time?&#34; He stated that we had called to complain that our food was once delivered to the wrong building. The doorman from the building across the street had to call for us to come and get it. \u00a0He also said that she keeps complaining about the sausage. \u00a0We couldn&#39;t believe what he had said and when she tried to respond, he hung up on her. <br>I threw on some clothes and walked to the diner which was less than three blocks from us but since having back surgery two months ago, walking was not the easiest of tasks. <br>I asked for the manager and was directed to a man who identified himself as &#34;Mike.&#34; \u00a0<br>Mike stated that my wife always &#34;complained&#34; that she wanted fresh sausage, and she has previously complained a couple of times that the there was a problem with our order. <br>I had to ask Mike if his restaurant was not an establishment where people paid to have food prepared the way they wanted. \u00a0I also asked if he knew the difference between a request and a complaint. He was dismissive. \u00a0He said that he never hung up on my wife, he was just busy. He repeated that he was tired of hearing her complain about the turkey sausage. <br>At the same time he admitted that the sausage may not have been sent in the best condition at least once or twice, and that he wrote down the wrong address that&#39;s why the food was delivered to the wrong building. <br>He really blew my mind when I asked him if today&#39;s complaint was unwarranted and he stated \u00a0&#34;You said both orders of French toast were burnt but only one order was burnt.&#34; \u00a0So in his mind, his justification for sending inedible food was that some of the food, in his opinion, was edible. \u00a0Instead of apologizing, he blamed my wife for calling to complain. Some of the customers who were seated nearby, kept shaking their heads in disbelief.<br>I realized that Mike was never going to admit that he was wrong. So I told him that he seriously needed to work on his customer service skills. \u00a0I then walked out of the restaurant. When I got home, my wife joked about getting money to bail me out of jail but thanked me for defending her honor. She knew I would handle the matter respectfully. <br>My final message to Mike is that in my opinion, there is a difference between a request when placing an order and complaining. Even if he doesn&#39;t agree with how an order is placed, he should remember that he works in the service industry. \u00a0I am not saying that anyone should disrespect you or your employees, which was certainly not the issue today. <br>If the order is wrong or the quality is poor, \u00a0just apologize and offer a refund or exchange.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 1, "reviewCount": 6, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "9/21/2021", "comment": {"text": "My wife and I went to the Utopia Diner this morning at 10:30.

The place is large with two levels of dining areas, and the bathroom was really nice and clean. Our servers and the manager (I think) were kind and attentive.

I was actually shocked to see this almost munchkin-sized cake served. It did come with a mint leaf, vanilla ice cream, and beautiful finishing.

Here&#39;s a breakdown of the vegan options I&#39;ve tried thus far. <br><br>Inday GoGo:<br>The basmati rice bowl with added chickpeas is great, as is the salad with added chickpeas. So flavorful, so colorful. Enough veggies in there to make you feel healthy. The cauli rice bowl with green kebab left me hungry and unsatisfied. The green kebab balls were tiny, light as air and there were only a couple of them. All around not hearty enough to get me through the afternoon. The staff and menu here are the most vegan friendly of all (and/or maybe just friendly!). <br><br>Taim:<br>The falafel platter is delicious if you&#39;re looking for a heavy vegan lunch. Creamy hummus, perfectly fluffy and fresh pita. Both the harissa and green falafel are great -- crunchy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside). I&#39;m not a huge tabbouli fan but this was pretty good - not too parsley-y. And the Israeli salad was whatever - vegetables, great. If you&#39;re looking for a lighter option, the green falafel salad is one of the best vegan salads in town (I add hummus for added protein and pickles to complete the flavor family). The lemon-mint dressing adds incredible brightness (though, you may want to order it on the side since it tends to pool at the bottom). <br><br>Dorado tacos:<br>The veggie Baja bowl (ordered without cheese, crema and the salad dressing) is a flavorful, veggie-ful and hearty lunch option. With yellow rice and black beans, pico and guac, some tortilla chips, grilled zucchini and red pepper, and a little lettuce-salad situation. <br><br>Baos by Kaya:<br>FYI, the tofu is deep fried in the same vat of oil as the meat, but I consider it to be vegan enough for me. The Buddha rice bowl (ordered without the green sauce and garlic sauce) is pretty good - the tofu&#39;s got great crispy crunchy flavor and they give you plenty of it. In my opinion, the coconut rice is what steals the show and adds subtle, but magical flavor throughout the dish. The veggies in the bowl (canned corn and shredded cabbage and kale) are kind of a throw away. Would love to see anything done to elevate these. The sweet chili sauce is fine but a little over powering - next time I&#39;ll get hoisin instead. Really wish the sesame noodles were vegan but there is egg in the noodles!<br><br>Takumi Taco:<br>The teriyaki bowl with tofu tinga was a protein fest. Brown rice, black beans, pinto beans, edamame and the tofu, with a tiny amount of veggies. The tofu had a nice texture - baked and marinated, had more of a Mexican flavor to it than Japanese (intentional, this place is fusion). All around it was good but needs some balance with some more veggies, more cool and crunch - maybe just make the slaw a bigger part of the dish. <br><br>Little Collins:<br>Incredible oat milk iced latte. And great cold brew. Even a milk drinker will love their oat milk drinks.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 2540, "reviewCount": 1034, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "4/24/2018", "comment": {"text": "Urbanspace is a food court off Lexington at 51st St. It was near where I was staying so we came here a few times to grab some food when we didn&#39;t want to go to a sit down restaurant for dinner. \u00a0<br><br>It&#39;s a good sized food court in midtown, near hotels, residences, offices, so it can be quite busy during lunch and dinner time.

Plus, the food comes out lukewarm and not hot like it should be. <br><br>The taste is decent but there&#39;s way too little curry with the rice to be called curry over rice. I don&#39;t think the food is freshly made either....more like pre-made because I placed my order at 5:14pm hence the receipt. The food is ready at 5:21pm. Last thing I know, you need at least 15-20 mins to freshly fry the chicken cutlet. And, there&#39;s no way cutlet of any kind can be finished with cooking in 7 mins. <br><br>Like I&#39;m saying, the food isn&#39;t freshly made which defeats the purpose of eating/dining at an eatery/restaurant. The curry is more towards sweet than spicy which is okay if you tend to like sweet curry. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be returning. In fact, this is my first time and possibly my last time eating at Urban Hawker. The curry taste is very similar to the chicken cutlet with curry from K-Town&#39;s Food Gallery 32. Except the portion size at Food Gallery 32 is larger and $2-3 cheaper than Smokin Joe from Urban Hawker. In other words, I would rather pay &amp; eat at FG32 than UH.

What a weird concept. You get hot rice and chicken on top of cold salad. They should make the sides warm. I got the yellow rice and lentil base which came with no lentil but rather raisins. It was really dry. Then I got the lime chicken which was basically boiled chicken with no flavor that was boiled so much that there&#39;s zero moisture in the chicken. The chilled broccoli salad which is cold boiled broccoli. The coco curry sauce which was good but you&#39;d need 4x the amount to make up for the dryness. And the jicama salad on the side which was fine.<br><br>Tomo Tomo: (5/5). I got the house special ramen with an extra egg and added on karaage to make it a combo. It came with a good amt of karaage so that was definitely good value for the extra $2.50. All the ramen comes with 2 pieces of pork belly (guessing except the veggie ramen), bamboo shoots, spinach, and scallions. They should make that more clear so the cashier isn&#39;t explaining it 2x per minute. Everything tasted great. The broth is really rich/thick and there isn&#39;t that much of it - I might have preferred a lighter broth. I came at 1:20pm and even though they say they have only 50 quantities of the house special, I was able to get it. The egg was cooked BEAUTIFULLY. Pork belly was very tender and thick as well.<br><br>Pita Yeerp (3.5/5). I got the bowl (salad + grape leaves + pita) with sides of marinated beans + french fries, got a mix of the lamb and chicken, topped with spicy feta. All came out to $13 something for a TON of food. They also had spanokopita and soup that I&#39;d like to try next time but the cashier rushed everything so I couldn&#39;t order it in time. The fries were meh (kinda stale), the beans were fine, the salad was like a cole slaw that was fine, the meat was fine and I couldn&#39;t really tell the difference between them, grape leaves were fine, spicy feta was fine.

Looked around as we walked toward Central Park and trusted Yelp reviews. With 4 stars here, USA Brooklyn won. We saw the diner first, they directed us back around to the tiny deli that is difficult to find - the entrance is on 7th Ave. not 57th St., if that helps. Fundamentally different places, this one has a few sandwich options and a few sides. My guest got the crispy chicken sandwich. I got the hot corned beef (full size, not the half one with cole slaw on it) plus a side of cole slaw. Plus Cel-Ray because I can. Opinions:<br>* Cole slaw is more like cole salt. Too spicy, and 6 oz is a bit much for one person. They don&#39;t really have individual portions unfortunately. It&#39;s in a pinkish sauce so it&#39;s not your typical cole slaw. Recommend giving it a pass.<br>* Did not taste the crispy sandwich but it was destroyed, so that&#39;s a positive sign.<br>* My sandwich was a bit fatty - I did not ask for lean so fine, that&#39;s my fault, but the menu doesn&#39;t include a lean option. Most delis have that even if it&#39;s an upcharge. Should have asked that, oh well. Once I got the five biggest clumps off, the rest was more or less all meat. I&#39;ve had way worse fat portions, fat on every piece, etc. - this is not as bad as all that but you will need a fork and knife to piece it apart before consuming. Very tasty. I asked for mustard and slathered it on. Sandwich is pictured coming with cheese. Mine did not and I wondered if they thought I wanted mustard /instead/ of cheese, as opposed to /in addition/. No reason to push it.<br>* Pickles are nothing outstanding. Standard size, not huge.<br>Service was a bit broken up - our sandwiches did not come out at the same time at all despite being on the same bill. Someone got a to-go of my sandwich just before my for-here came out. But it made it. That&#39;s the service you&#39;ll get.<br>Verdict: I miss the old places.
