I came here with a chum on Friday for lunch (she opted for chicken curry nearby, which after sampling, I am absolutely getting soon as well). I&#39;ve ordered from a handful of places in here before, and they&#39;ve all been solid. Urbanspace still somehow feels like a bit of a secret in the area months after opening, maybe because the exterior/windows are so dark that you really don&#39;t know what&#39;s in here without physically wandering in. I assume other Urbanspaces pretty much look like this, but for me the best comp is District Kitchen in Jersey City, which I spent a lot of time in a few years ago - edgy, with some decent food options (and the best cortado in the world, courtesy of Modcup). <br><br>This was probably my third time at Que Chevere and the best experience. Without a doubt, that&#39;s in no small part due to them having the almighty mofongo available (which is a scrumptious recommend if you&#39;ve never had PR cuisine - fried plaintains/garlic that pairs well with basically any seasoned meat). I&#39;ve had mofongo a bunch of times in this area and in San Juan. This is the most generous portion I&#39;ve had around here at least; as you can see from the pic, the mofongo is gigantic and I think I got through about half of it. The only way I think you can really mess this up is if you let it linger in the deep fryer for too long and don&#39;t provide accompanying sauces or juicy sides to moisten it up. Neither happened here (I did somehow lose my cilantro sauce on the way to the table. No idea how.), and the pernil/pork was excellent. I&#39;d say both prior times there were at least one or two hunks of meat that were just charred up to the point of inedible and/or strips that were literally just fat that I avoided. Every piece of the shredded pork was on point this time around. My chum impulsively ordered a side of tostones, which I sampled a piece of (I mean, it&#39;s basically the mofongo in a different format) and was pleasantly surprised at the seasoning/taste.<br><br>The price point to me is all over the place in Urbanspace - I maintain that the Playa Bowls here and down the street is too overpriced, but the pizza in the corner is pretty competitive - but this one seems about right, MAYBE a dollar or two too much. The whole entree was $18 but again, you&#39;re getting a giant piece of mofongo made to order, and a huge helping of pork. Beyond that, the people behind the counter are always super friendly and perhaps because it&#39;s a little tucked away by the Coney Island stall, never seems to have too long of a wait either to order or receive food.

However, Que Chevere&#39;s ensalada de papa was surprisingly delicious despite it having onions in it. It didn&#39;t have that overpowering &#34;onion-y&#34; taste.

Ive only bought food at this location like once or twice and their new location near Lexington once. Their creativity shows in how they decorate. It catches your eye. <br><br>I personally don&#39;t really like to shop for Mexican food since I&#39;m Mexican myself and literally eat this type of food everyday. Although I can&#39;t remember what I had at this location (it was probably a quesadilla like five to ten years ago), I visited their newest location on Lexington and was sort of underwhelmed by the food. I decided to order a Tlacoyo, a Chile Relleno taco, and a Gordita. Yeah I eat a lot. <br><br>The gordita I ordered was of chicharron (fried pork). The only upside of the gordita was its size and the fact that they have epazote mixed in, a nice addition to the gordita. It was completely cut in half through the middle so it looked more like an arepa. It&#39;s usually cut in half through the middle but only half of the gordita. That&#39;s so it can be stuffed inside with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese and be able to hold all of these contents without falling apart. It&#39;s also easier to hold that way and eat. But since it was cut completely down the middle, it mostly felt apart as I tried holding it. I was also disappointed with the texture of the gordita. It felt old. That&#39;s usually noticeable when the masa is already cooked and reheated. <br><br>The tlacoyo/huarache I was given was definitely NOT a tlacoyo. If you don&#39;t know what that is, it&#39;s a thick patty made of the same masa (dough) that&#39;s used for the tortillas and stuffed with dried beans. Once cooked, it&#39;s served with toppings, usually lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese, and meat if you order it. I ordered it with steak and when I opened it up at home, I was confused as to whether I ordered a tlacoyo or quesadilla or if they mixed up my order. They gave me an opened up tortilla (the ones made for quesadillas) and served it flat with beans (not dried) and all of the toppings I mentioned earlier. It looked more like a giant taco that had its contents already picked out and I was getting leftovers. That was rather disappointing.<br><br>Lastly, the Chile relleno (Stuffed pepper) taco was alright. It was probably the best thing I ordered. The tortilla was hand made and served with rice (but no jalape\u00f1os which should&#39;ve been added since it&#39;s advertised as &#34;Taco Placeros&#34; which includes both rice and jalape\u00f1os). The pepper was large and stuffed with frying cheese (queso de frier) so the texture is a bit stiff and rubbery. It was a tad spicy, which I don&#39;t mind. The pepper was also left with the top part that included the stem. I&#39;ve definitely had it without so I thought that was rather lazy.<br><br>Their places are definitely aesthetically pleasing. But so are many other places and I wouldn&#39;t come here just for that alone. I&#39;ve read other comments praising the place for hand made tortillas but there are other places nearby that also make and serve hand made tortillas so that&#39;s not really unique. Budget wise, it can be worked with for some. I think the cheapest thing on the menu was $4 (can&#39;t remember the menu). The three things I ordered came out to around $27. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend the place but that&#39;s because when I want to go out and eat, I never stay in my neighborhood.

Why? Mainly because of my fear of becoming fat. And while it&#39;s easy for me to stay away from the golden arches, so many Americans are addicted to, I have not been able to curb my cravings for certain Latin foods... especially the ones I relied upon to cure hangovers, or to recharge my battery. These truck food specialties are the reason I&#39;m alive today. I&#39;m pretty sure. They are also the reason why I still drink, living life the way I did in my 20&#39;s, you would&#39;ve thought I&#39;d never pick up the hooch again. <br><br>My two biggest weaknesses? Cachapas and chimichurris. <br><br>What are these? A cachapa is a sandwich, where the dough is thin, sweet cornmeal, and the fillings vary from chicken, beef, pork or all of the above. <br>A chimichurri is a Dominican burger, where the patty is seasoned to savory perfection, topped with cabbage, tomatoes, \u00a0a mayo &amp; ketchup mixture, sometimes pickled onions, and/or hot sauce. There is really no uniformity to the chimi, every truck, or in this case restaurant, has it&#39;s own recipe and everyone has a favorite. <br><br>But I don&#39;t go out til the wee hours of the mornings, wearing shoes that make it nearly impossible to walk the next day.

I got the jelly and peanut butter on the side so I could portion the size on the bacon - that&#39;s the way to go. I wish the bacon was a little thicker, but it was still good. Kind of small though.<br><br>Monkey Bread: 0/10<br><br>It unfortunately came out hard and cold. I had a bite and felt like I got a sense of what it would be like. I can&#39;t really comment because I sent it back but I&#39;m surprised they even let it come out cold and hard.<br><br>Patty Melt: 9/10<br><br>YES. This was scrumptious! The meat was juicy and there were several layers. I loved the cheese and toast. I got the Cole slaw replaced with fries - definitely the move. The fries were deliciously crispy and well seasoned. My one note is that the patty could be spread out more because I got a lot of only bread bites and the juices quickly soaked the bread. It made it soggy, which can be fine, but because the sandwich was cut in quarters it couldn&#39;t really hold.<br><br>Bavette: 4/10<br><br>For a steak restaurant, this really missed the mark. I asked for it medium rare but it was a little too rare making the steak disgustingly chewy. The outside though was charred and burnt so it was such a weird combination in your mouth. Some steak should be good alone but this definitely needed something to make it edible. I got it with a salad but the salad had a lot of red cabbage, which I imagine being in more of a coke slaw.<br><br>Sticky Toffee: 8/10<br><br>I love this dessert too and was craving it (after having it at Quality Meats). Unfortunately it was a bit dry. It could have used more sauce but was still very tasty and nice and hot.<br><br>Overall this place is average. Great for the bacon and patty melt but skip the steak.

My company always claims this may be one of the best french bistros in NYC, \u00a0so I figured id give it second chance before I write something wrongful that may taint the name and reputation. <br>I do believe every restaurant deserved a second chance before you can honestly rate it accurately on its quality and service. Although my first experience was nothing to rave about and a actually a bit disappointing, the second attempt was much much better. <br>First off, this place is packed on a saturday night, and for some strange reason everyone looked french to me. The origin of this name comes from its first location on 14th street, which may explain why the place is called &#34;Quatorze&#34; translates to fourteen in english. The place looks very much a like a classic bistro, with pictures all over the walls, marble floors and the awning out front. <br>The staff tonight was superb to say the least. Patient, Pleasant, and most important, Courteous. Our server was very kind from start to finish and checked up on our table periodically even with a busy night like tonight. Drinks were delivered very quickly which is something Ive come to notice is hard to come by these days. <br>The menu is very simple and not extremely impressive in description, meaning nothing that catches your eye or makes your mouth salivate when reading it. It would be nice to have a none stained paper menu when you charge such prices. And when I say prices are a bit steep, they are. No entree under $30. <br>So why do you ask me that I rate this place so well... the whole package ofcourse. Although the menu may be up there in $$, most people dont mind paying if their experience was worth it. The Service, Top Notch! The Food, made with passion and talent. And the ambiance was comfortable and warm. <br>The hostess was a gem from start to finish, checking up on our table and helping out when needed. The server was descriptive of the menu and knew exactly what he was elaborating on, which in other cases drives me crazy when you get server with zero food knowledge. He wasnt pushy or looked annoyed when asked a question, looked you in the eye and spoke with manner.. A+++. Oh and he threw in a few extras along the way.<br>Ok, now the food. I was introduced to a french fish soup, the Bouillabaisse. Presented beautifully with pieces of arctic char, monk fish, scallops, clams and mussels. It was absolutely superb to say the least. It was a great portion and the broth.... WOW. It was also topped with a Croutini that was flaky like a \u00a0croissant and was in the shape of a fish. All the fish itself was super fresh and tasty, scallops were so sweet and juicy. <br>I also started with the chicken liver appetizer, which was great! about 4-5 pieces of liver \u00a0in a reduced sauce.<br>The kicker of the night was the dessert which was heavenly. Oh my, it was every kids and adults dream dessert. Puff Pastry on top, Vanilla bean ice cream center, Biscuit wafer on the bottom, and all that topped with bitter sweet chocolate. I can&#39;t even express how amazing this was after my meal. I told my diet to turn away for a minute while I scarfed that down. Comes in 3 pieces btw. I was a bit disappointed by the sweetbread entree. Small portion and high price. Four pieced of sweet bread over a small cup portion of angel hair.

After a lovely early evening stroll through the park, we made our way to the restaurant. It feels a bit like a hidden gem. The decor is interesting: many tables across several levels, unique lighting, a lot of wood and leather. The tables are very close together, so close it almost feels like you are having dinner with your dining neighbors - I am intimately familiar with the dating life of one of the gentlemen sitting next to us. We opted for the filet, the New York strip, the Quality potato, and the asparagus. The steaks were perfectly cooked; you might be surprised to know that so many steakhouses can&#39;t seem to cook a steak! The Quality potato is the best twice-baked potato you&#39;ll ever have. It&#39;s large enough for two people and delicious. The asparagus is asparagus...nothing new there but well done nonetheless. We were stuffed at the end of the meal and opted not to have a dessert, even though the sticky toffee pudding was calling my name. The thing that keeps me from giving this restaurant a full five stars is the noise. Oh my gosh, is it loud in here. I half yelled across the (small) table at my husband that I didn&#39;t think he would be whispering sweet nothings to me during dinner. It is unbelievably loud here.
