Then she took out a large chunk of lamb and put it back into the large meat tray. Then she stirred the noodles again, and took out another large chunk of lamb to put back in the large meat tray again.

The skin was slightly crispy, though I confess it sat on the table about 15 minutes while I focused on lobster.

The staff was friendly and quick to bring our order, they brought them in succession. After one was finished they brought out the next dish. Great service.<br>What we order was the following:<br>Snow \u00a0white Pork bun 5/5 light soft delicious and sweet. You can easily eat more than 2-3 that comes in the order.<br>Deep fried pork dumpling 4.5/5 - these were so crispy and the meat so tender inside. They do burn your tongue a little as they come straight to the table after being deep fried.<br>Pork Buns - 3/5 these buns were good but i found them to be a little heavy and very greasy on the outside. Not one that i would order again for myself but willing to eat if they are brought out.<br>Pan fried chive shrimp dumpling 5/5 these pan fried dumplings were very surprising. it contains a lot of chives and the right amount of shrimp. they were a little to big to pick up with the chopsticks so i cut them in half but i&#39;m so glad that it was a nice amount/size of the dumpling.<br>Dan Dan noodles - 4/5 there noodles were really good. I had never tried dan dan noodles before and so getting them at this very nice location seemed like a good idea. the meat and noodles were delicious but the broth was a little too salty for me. <br>Singapore Mai Fun - 4/5 these noodles were interesting.

The ambiance inside is pretty nice and it&#39;s sort of has Shanghai/canto vibes when you order and sit down. The price point is on the higher end of dim sum but whatever we tasted was also on the higher end of flavor. <br><br>We ordered the black gold egg custard bun, the egg tarts, avocado shrimp spring rolls, the siu mai, prawn dumplings, sheng Jian bao, and the braised e-fu noodle. First of all- they didn&#39;t serve us any house tea but that&#39;s because this place isn&#39;t really completely Cantonese style that I&#39;m used to (it&#39;s not a big tea parlour) tea is 5 dollars for anyone ordering... and it comes in your own personal size pot. Everything we got was really good and everyone really enjoyed what they got. My Shanghainese friend thought the flavors were authentic to her culture and as a Cantonese person who grew up eating dim sum I would say this taste even more flavorful than some I&#39;ve had in Brooklyn&#39;s Chinatown. <br><br>To start off, the black custard buns and the egg tarts were off the charts. 100% recommend. <br>I really enjoyed the prawn dumpling as the skin was softer than the normal dumpling and I liked that it had 4 different colors- there is no flavor change by the way. One of the best things on here is actually the avocado and shrimp spring rolls- I thought that was really inventive but not traditional (which is what I&#39;m usually looking for but in this case I enjoyed it a lot) the braised E-fu noodle was soooo good and it was vegetarian friendly as well for one of my party to share with all of us. The noodle texture was bouncy and really flavorful and I thought it was probably one of the best ones I&#39;ve had. The siu mai was probably the only one I was ok with mainly because I feel like you can&#39;t go wrong with it but it will never really blow your mind. It tastes like a traditional recipe so if you just crave siu mai this place also has it but I would rather stick to a cheaper place that serves good siu mai mainly because you can get it somewhere else. I feel like this place is better for some of the other different and more modern dim sum.<br><br>The only thing that bothered me was that when we asked the waiter about the drinks he said he had soda and juice.

I liked that some of their dumplings came in a smaller portion, which would have allowed me to try more things. I decided I was going to order the truffled soup dumplings and the dandan noodles.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t very busy when I walked in. 2 tables finishing up. The server gave me a main menu and a laminated one with some photos. Hmmm....ok.... I ask for a drink menu and she tells me the bartender is not there and that they have beer and wine but not a list. What? No cocktail list of your &#39;elegant cocktails?&#39; I inquired about the white wine they had and she just said, &#39;sauvignon blanc,&#39; and asked if I&#39;d like a glass. That struck me as a bit odd that there is only ONE type of white option. You don&#39;t have any Chablis? Sancerre? Champagne or even prosecco?<br><br>The menu was a lot shorter than the one posted on their website. Hmmm, where are those truffled soup dumplings? The dandan noodles? Oh well, maybe it&#39;s a shorter lunch menu? I don&#39;t know...<br><br>The server comes by again and asks me what I&#39;d like to order, I tell her I need a moment as the two things I was going to order, were not on the menu.

He says no, &#34;it&#39;s Sauvignon Blanc.&#34; And then he just stares at me. &#34;Where is it from?&#34; I ask. Geez, these people sure really don&#39;t know how to sell. He tells me California. Not wanting to get hosed on boxed wine, I decline. But then at some point maybe 5 minutes later, I change my mind when he came by to ask me what else I wanted. Mind you, my first order hasn&#39;t arrived. I tell him I have changed mind and I would like a glass of wine, please. He goes away, to get said wine, but comes back to say that they are all out!! After all of that! What a joke! He then ask me if I&#39;d like to get up to follow him to the bar to pick something else. What kind of mind is this to think that you can go from choosing a glass of crisp wine, to going for a scotch or a rum or who knows what else?<br><br>He asks me again if I&#39;d like anything else, so I just randomly pick &#39;assorted steamed vegetables&#39;, you know, for greens lol.

Maybe she&#39;s upper management? Who knows. They were near the front and I was closer to the back. I was mucking around on my phone, about to eat a dumpling, when I felt that someone was staring at me. So I have this dumpling in my chopsticks about to go into my mouth and I see them staring at me, so we all kinda pause!! Lol! <br><br>I just felt so alienated and weirded out at this point that when the sever came by, I told her I had to go and that I would like the bill, please.

The interior is elegant and there is a swanky feel to the place. The downstairs level is sleek with a fancy lit-up bar. The upstairs level was sophisticated and a sight to behold: Green vines hanging from the ceiling, dark brown wood paneling and dark blue and gold designs on the walls, along with plush white seats. <br><br>I came here with a friend for dinner and we shared 3 different dishes, as well as a pot of tea. We were served a complimentary basket of egg waffle, which was very yummy. The waffles were warm, moist, fluffy and filled with custard that was just the right amount of sweetness. <br><br>The tea we selected was called, Five Elements, which consisted of hawthorne berry, goji berry, shou wu, Chinese date, and longan. This was served in a pretty glass teapot, then poured into tiny glass cups. The taste was delightfully delicate and truly exquisite! I was able to discern the flavor of each ingredient. What impressed me was that the tea was made with the actual, fresh ingredients, rather than tea bags or leaves.<br><br>For our appetizer, we ordered the Shanghai Truffle Wontons, which were amazing! They were pan-fried and yellow and green in color. These were perfect morsels with pork / veggie filling and strong taste of delicious, mouthwatering truffle. It was my favorite of the evening. <br><br>Then we had Live Blue Crab with Rice Cake. The crab was great, with wonderful seasoning and tender, juicy meat. However, the crab was still in the shell so it a bit tough to get to that meat. Rice cake was cooked to perfection - Sticky and chewy. The rice cakes had tasty crab flavoring.<br><br>My friend chose the YangZhou Noodle in Clear Broth, which included pork belly, lava egg, and bok choy. I really enjoyed the pork belly - It was lean so I didn&#39;t have to worry about removing the fat and it was sooo succulent! The bok choy was slightly crispy, while the lava egg was a nice addition. Love that creamy bright yellow yolk. <br><br>The prices are a bit high, but with the Yelp check-in, you can get 15% off. Service was top notch. They were able to accommodate my friend and me at an earlier time. The host and waiter welcomed us and throughout the meal, they made sure we were taken care of.

The restaurant was filled with people but the waiters, waitresses and hostess handled everything with grace and care. <br><br>The best dish was the King Crab noodles with Uni. Best tea was the Chinese Almond Pearl Barley. <br><br>We shared the following.<br><br>Morchella Esculenta Soup Dumpling- this was a gigantic soup dumpling with savory mushroom meaty soup with lots of morels inside. I loved the metal straws that came in a tiny glass jar. It was so fun to share this dish! <br><br>After the soup was enjoyed, we cut up the soup dumpling to enjoy the morels. The skin was surprisingly thin and delicate for such a large dumpling. I&#39;ve had much thicker skinned soup dumplings in Shanghai. <br><br>Shanghai Truffle Wontons- these were nice and crispy on the bottom. They smelled so good and were moist inside. It was slightly better than your usual wontons.<br><br>The King Crab Cold Noodles with Uni and caviar- this was the best dish of the night! I loved the fresh caviar. We mixed it so the caviar, cold cucumber, and king crab coated each noodle. The noodles were al dente and the uni offered this oceanic taste to the dish. K loved it too! We fought over the last bite. <br><br>Saut\u00e9ed Tier Prawn and Lobster Risotto- The lobster tail was cut up already. The tiger prawns were springy and well cooked. This was more of a fried rice than a risotto. It was good.<br><br>Flaming Ribeye- this was very entertaining. The rib eye was cut up and well done. I loved the stones that were lit on fire. The meat was flavorful and cooked completely. <br><br>For dessert: egg yolk sesame ball. I liked this. It was the combination of two great dim sums: salted egg yolk bun and fried sesame ball. <br><br>Tea: Chinese Almond Pearl Barley tea. This was slightly sweet, warm and clear clean taste. I loved it!

There are several locations, so I picked the one that was near where we were for the day.<br><br>We ordered upfront first, paid, and then picked seating inside after getting our vaccine card and ID checked. We picked a spread of three items that appeared popular and yummy:<br><br>* stewed pork burger ($5.25)<br>* spicy and tingly beef hand-ripped noodles, mild ($11.75)<br>* spicy and sour pork and cabbage dumplings, mild ($8.75)<br><br>The pork burger sounds like an American burger with a pork patty, but it&#39;s actually more like an open sided pork bun. The pork inside was pork belly, so I enjoyed it way more than BF did, as he preferred his meats lean. The pork burger had a lot of rich flavor! The hand-ripped noodles also had a lot of flavor and even though I usually like my noodles soggy, the thick and chewy texture of this dish worked for me. Even though we ordered mild, you still get a good enough kick of spice. Same goes for the dumplings, which comes in 6 in one order. If you order the noodles or dumplings, make sure you don&#39;t wear any light colored tops or make a makeshift bib from the napkin or be alert while handling each bite, because the sauce from either dish might make it onto you at some point!<br><br>Most people order their food to-go, but there were several dine-in customers like us, so spots inside can get filled quick at the right time.
