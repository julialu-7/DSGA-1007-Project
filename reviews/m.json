The roll itself also fell apart on most pieces. <br><br>Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll (3/5): Not really any crunch. Not very spicy either. Tuna was alright. <br><br>Salmon Skin Roll (4/5): Excellent salmon skin but wished they put in just a tiny bit more as these pieces were tiny compared to the others. Right amount of sauce on these. <br><br>Salmon Roe Ikura Piece (2/5): Ugh this piece wasn&#39;t good. The fish eggs were somewhat hard, sour, and wrinkled and thus clearly not fresh. The cucumber it came in was nice and the portion was good -- too bad it wasn&#39;t palatable. <br><br>Scallion Pancake (4/5): Lost a little crunch in transportation but an excellent flavor. Very flakey and delish though. <br><br>Philadelphia Roll (4/5): Love the proportion of avocado to salmon to cream cheese. Salmon not the freshest but otherwise a good roll for what it is. <br><br>Whitefish Tempura Roll (3/5): Tempura was a little soggy and the fish was fine. Cucumber and avocado added a nice flavor. Right amount of eel sauce. <br><br>Hot &amp; Sour Soup (4/5): Good flavor overall<br><br>Egg Drop Soup (1/5): It was so thick that it looked more like a gelatinous blob than actual liquid. So gross. <br><br>Vegetable Lo Mein (2/5): Literally noodles, oil and some veggies. No brown sauce. No nothing. So bland on its own. Added my own soy sauce and sriracha to make this palatable. <br><br>Miso Soup (3/5): It&#39;s miso soup but kinda bland and not a lot of seaweed plus it has just a little bit of super tiny tofu <br><br>Vegetable Gyoza (3/5): A bit rubbery. Inside is fine. Dipping sauce is what you&#39;d expect. <br><br>Price (5/5): Extremely affordable.

Sure, if they don&#39;t know you, sometimes they are nervous and awkward and some of the server&#39;s English isn&#39;t top tier, but once you get to talking to them, they are seriously the nicest people you&#39;ll meet. They are super FLEXIBLE. With my dinner bento I customize my dish (to be chicken and broccoli with curry sauce) and also replace the eggroll/sushi with extra fried shumai. They have never once told me they can&#39;t substitute anything. They make it so you&#39;re priority. <br>Food: INSANELY cheap and pretty fucking good. I gotta give ya&#39;ll a few tips: first, ALWAYS ORDER THE LUNCH SET IF IT&#39;S LUNCH. Their Chinese food is what you should be going there for (sushi is pretty eh and Thai/Viet/Japanese is also eh). Next, if you like seafood, GET the shrimp. They give excess portions of it and it&#39;s pretty good and sizable. IF YOU LIKE MEAT, GET THE CHICKEN!! They actually use white meat and it&#39;s incredibly tender. All 30+ times I&#39;ve ordered delivery/gone, it has been this way. Of all their meats, it&#39;s the highest quality. I always get the dinner bento but their actual dinner portions are GIANT. The bowl is literally about a foot wide and long. It&#39;s two days portions. But if you like variety, go for the dinner bento. If you like egg drop soup, they make some of the best. Not too much M&amp;G and enough clotted eggs to give you a great real texture. The wontons in the wonton soup are premade and the hot and sour is pretty good. The miso soup is miso soup, can&#39;t really fuck it up.<br>Atmosphere: It&#39;s a pretty fucking clean with the minimal occasion of a few sticky parts of a menu. It&#39;s usually never packed so you always get a seat and can watch T.V. It&#39;s really divey with a mix of Chinese and American iconography and whatever. If my mom opened up a restaurant it would look just like this. It&#39;s really modest, reminds you of home, and doesn&#39;t try to be anything.<br><br>Overall, I gotta say, I&#39;ve gone countless times and they&#39;ve never disappointed me. In terms of food quality, price, atmosphere, service, etc., they are as good as you are gonna get. They exceed my criteria in all these fields (quality is actually above average if you know what to get, price is far below average, I mean, 7 bucks for a full meal, come ON, atmosphere is down to Earth and sticky but really fucking endearingly home-like, and service is superb).<br><br>tl;dr I found at home at M&amp;J.

The 3.5 stars on the review didn&#39;t exactly win me over either, but my friend assured me that this place was good. When I actually arrived, I had to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is old, but it looks clean (and it was well air-conditioned too!). <br><br>We went a little crazy with ordering because everything looked so good and it was also just so cheap. For the three of us, we ordered the following:<br><br>1) H.K. Style Steamed Rice Noodle: 3.5/5 - This dish is a rice noodle roll that is covered in a sweet soy sauce and peanut sauce. It&#39;s not as soft as your typical steamed rice noodle roll, but it&#39;s still good. However, since one of our party is allergic to peanuts, the sheer quantity to split between two made it easy to lose its appeal amongst all the other good food that we had too. <br><br>2) Shrimp Steamed Rice Noodle: 5/5 - I have a soft spot for this dish, and this was so good. For only $3.50, the portion almost seems bigger than what you&#39;d get at your traditional dim sum restaurant. The sauce was very good and the shrimp very tender.<br><br>3) Fried Dough: 2.5/5 - This dish was just okay. We had originally intended to eat this with our congee, but the congee came first and we sort of forgot about it. It was a bit more oily than I would have liked but not too bad. It&#39;s only $1.50, so what more can you expect?<br><br>4) Preserved Egg &amp; Lean Pork Congee: 4.5/5 - It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had a good bowl of this congee (the last place I ordered it from was so gross so I was worried I was going to get something similar). However, it was actually really flavorful. Highly recommend!<br><br>5) Pork Chop with Instant Noodle: 5/5 - I never thought I would come to a restaurant to eat instant noodles but this was so good. There was actually a good number of pork chops in the noodles and the noodles themselves were cooked to just the right consistency. It does make me think though that I can probably learn to make this myself at home, but nonetheless, it was nice to learn that it isn&#39;t always a bad idea to order instant noodles at a restaurant.<br><br>6) H.K. Style Milk Tea: 5/5 - Perfect for the very hot day that we were eating on. The sweetness was not overwhelming and it was overall very refreshing.<br><br>7) Pan-Fried Dumplings: 3/5 - It wasn&#39;t bad, but compared to all the other dishes, it failed to shine. I think it was also just so heavy and with how much food we already consumed, it wasn&#39;t super appealing anymore to have to finish a plate of dumplings. There are definitely better dumplings in the Chinatown area.<br><br>Service is on the slower side, but they were very nice and got us everything that we needed.

The dill and olive pairing, as well as a strong olive oil flavor complemented the fragrant scallops. <br>3. Trout (6/10): I had seen positive reviews about the trout online, but I was not impressed with it.

I bookmarked Ma-de the moment I read that the Wayan team was opening a new spot. I loved Wayan and I tend to enjoy any kind of unique fusion restaurant, so I was excited to experience the sequel. The service was slow at times (but everyone who worked there was very nice), and the food ranged from great to outstanding, with diverse and sophisticated preparations highlighting seafood and veggies. SoHo has never been known as a mecca for great restaurants but Cedric &amp; Ochi are building a dynasty down here. <br><br>We came here at 8:30 on a Saturday night. I&#39;m not sure why this surprised me, but the space is tiny. This would explain why getting a reservation here can be challenging. The space is lively and green, with lots of vegetation and beautiful light fixtures. We had reserved counter seating, meaning the surface we&#39;d need to eat on was quite narrow. We asked the hostess if we could switch to a proper table if it became available and she said she&#39;d let us know. In the meantime, she said, the party at our table was just finishing up, so we could plan to start off there. However, for whatever reason, we didn&#39;t get to sit down for about 30 minutes. Luckily we were not in a rush. When we finally did sit down, it turned out that a new table towards the back of the space would be opening up, so we didn&#39;t spend much time perched up at the counter. Worth the wait, I&#39;d say. <br><br>To start, we ordered cocktails. The drink list is pretty exciting here, bursting with creativity and ingredients not typically found in cocktails. I first got the Huatulco (mezcal, rhubarbaro, beets, yuzu vinegar, chile puya, lemon oil), an earthy, citrusy, bright, and subtly spicy mezcal drink that unintentionally served as an amuse bouche. Second, I ended up getting the Gibson that&#39;s on their drink menu. I typically get classic or dirty martinis but our server said the Gibson was particularly good with the gin that they use here (I had never heard of it before and since forgot the name) so I opted for that. It was wonderfully smooth and paired very nicely with all of the food.<br><br>Food-wise, it seems pretty hard to go wrong here. I think our ordering strategy was the perfect way to go in hindsight: two raw (seafood) dishes, two veg, two cooked (seafood) dishes. Yes, some of the portions are quite small for the price (I&#39;m looking at you, lobster). If you go in knowing that, perhaps you&#39;ll be less miffed by this. I once payed 30 extra dollars to try a lobster dish on a tasting menu in Greece, and the piece of lobster was about the size of a blackberry, so this was generous by comparison. Eats, below: \u00a0<br><br>Mushrooms w/ parmesan, pine nuts, sancho pepper: A+<br>These were an easy sell. Rich and earthy, colorful and well-presented, these are mushrooms done right. <br><br>Artichokes w/ black olives, basil, lemon: A+<br>We initially ordered the avocado salad but they mistakenly brought us the artichokes. It was honestly a blessing in disguise, because I was always team artichoke (my husband isn&#39;t really a fan). However, this was, as one of the staff described it, an artichoke dish for people who don&#39;t like artichokes. Crispy and super flavorful, just perfect execution. <br><br>Fluke w/ kombu cured, green chili, shiso: A-<br>Delicate and fresh, a solid raw dish, nothing that exciting though. <br><br>Tuna w/ kewpie mayo, ficelle, spruce: A<br>Our server talked this up and while it wasn&#39;t our favorite dish of the night, it was still delicious. I haven&#39;t had kewpie mayo -- at least as part of a tuna tartare dish -- before, it added some extra flavor to the dish. <br><br>Lobster w/ dumplings, caviar sauce, chives: A+<br>The aforementioned expensive lobster, but it was so, so good. I mean, lobster in caviar sauce, can you get anymore decadent? Maybe sprinkle some truffle on there for good measure? I&#39;m kidding, of course, this was wonderful as is. <br><br>Octopus w/ sweet peppers, tomato, basil: A+<br>We initially decided against the octopus because we were recently in Greece and had it probably 10 times while we were there (it does happen to be my favorite food). But when we asked about it, our server explained the preparation including a slow-braising process and it made it sound too go to pass up. I&#39;m glad we went for it, because it was outstanding.

I was absolutely ecstatic to check-out the mahjong themed cafe. This retro restaurant is serving up nostalgic Hong Kong (HK) style dishes. Classic favorites include the standard dark milk tea (served hot or iced), instant ramen noodle bowls, curry fish balls, and Chinese style spaghetti.<br><br>HK Style Spaghetti - $14.99 - Mac and<br>Cheese fans should give this dish a try. The cheese level on this dish is set on high. HK style spaghetti tends to be on the slightly sweeter side. I personally like this style but I recognize that sweet spaghetti is not for everyone. The dish isn&#39;t overly sweet like pasta from a can of Chef Boyardee, but please be warned. <br><br>Instant Ramen Noodle Bowl - $18.99. My party chose the combination style that includes spam, pan seared pork chop, chicken cutlet, sausage, and a sunny side up egg. This dish was very comforting and very filling. If you&#39;re not a fan of American hot dog or spam, I would recommend trying out another dish since it&#39;s a little on the pricey side. For meat and noodle lovers...this dish was made for you. \u00a0<br><br>Piggy Bun - $7.99 - 2 slices - Yum, Yum, Yum! Imagine a dinner roll with butter and condensed milk. How can you go wrong with that combination? Mabu Cafe also adds salted egg yolk shavings to the bun to help add a savory element. The combination of flavors is stunning and quite the explosion in your mouth. It&#39;s hard to not take more than one bite. \u00a0<br><br>Overall, I would absolutley love to come back to this restaurant and bring my family here. There are still a lot of menu items that I wish I could try but my stomach had already maxed out. <br><br>My mom is a mahjong enthusiast and was also born in Hong Kong.

Now that the hype has died down a little, we finally came here tonight.<br><br>On this rainy Sunday night our group of 4 arrived at 6:30pm and waited perhaps 10 min to be seated. I hear the wait is still pretty bad during lunch hours.<br><br>We ordered a bunch of food that bloggers on \u5c0f\u7d05\u66f8 raved about, and they were not wrong!<br><br>For appetizers, we got the Hong Kong Style Curry Fish Ball, which was good but pretty pricey at $1 per fish ball. The sauce was good and I mixed it with the instant noodle from another dish.<br><br>The standout for me was the BBQ Pork on Lard Rice \u9eef\u7136\u92b7\u9b42\u53c9\u71d2\u8c6c\u6cb9\u62cc\u98ef. The pork was on the sweet side (even more so than the usual char siu), which I loved, and the rice was so well flavored. \u00a0The BBQ pork itself was sweeter than and as high quality as what the ever popular Wah Fung offers. The rice itself was a notch above Wah Fung&#39;s, and the two sunny side up eggs made the dish a much fuller experience. Of course Mabu is at a higher price point altogether, and the comparison is only to add a bit color.<br><br>The Pepper with Hog Maw and Chicken Hotpot \u80e1\u6912\u8c6c\u809a\u96de\u934b was another hit with our group. It might taste foreign to people not from Hong Kong, but I&#39;d encourage you to try it. I really wanted to order the durian soup as well but it was sold out.<br><br>The other main dishes we tried were Pork Chop+Chicken Cutlet+Sausage+AAA Strip Loin Steak, Chicken Cutlet w.Scallion Oil on Instant Noodle and Baked Cheese Garlic Creamy Curry Chicken Cutlet. They were all delicious, filling dishes and I especially enjoyed the last one. Some came with sunny side up eggs, and for some reason I just loved those. I got the Hong Kong style milk tea (drinks came with the mains) and while it was good it wasn&#39;t especially so.<br><br>We ordered only two desserts, (1) the Molten Salted Egg Yolk French Toast w. Pork Floss and (2) the Piggy Bun w.Condensed Milk, Butter &amp; Molten Salted Egg Yolk. They had similar ingredients but the latter was far superior in taste. The French toast had barely any pork floss on it.<br><br>Overall, Mabu was an amazing experience and it blew Kong Sihk Tong, which I still love, out of the water. They target the same diners and I frankly see no reason to go to KST anymore.<br><br>Given the very long menu, there are so many other dishes I need to go back to Mabu for, but now I know there are a few staples to order every time.<br><br>It was $138 for 4 people inc taxes, not too bad for 8 dishes and 4 drinks!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 108, "reviewCount": 78, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "5/21/2023", "comment": {"text": "I have been dying to try the Mabu Cafe out because of the hype. \u00a0Though the wait is just way too long. \u00a0We came here on a Friday at 2pm and we waited an hour to get in there (just the two of us).<br><br>The design of this cafe is up to part as a Hong Kong style cafe with the limited space it offers.

Even though I am a HongKonger, I have been away long enough to know that authentic restaurants are scarce overseas. I never expect anything as long as it&#39;s decent and edible. But this cafe has totally changed my view. Turns out food can be so bad and left us feeling hangry and hugely disappointed. I apologise for everyone who came in, tried the food and left feeling unimpressed. I swear Hong Kong food is good, but this place is just not it.<br><br>~ Baked cheese w/ Tomato sauce &amp; Pork Cutlet ~<br>When the server brought us the rice, we thought they delivered the wrong item. Where is the tomato sauce? The server said it&#39;s underneath the pork cutlet. My heart sank as soon as I heard that. That&#39;s when I know this meal is going to be a disaster. The fried pork cutlet has a golden crust that looks appetising, but that&#39;s an illusion. The meat is very dry, topped with rubbery cheese, I am desperately needing some tomato sauce to balance out the dryness, but it&#39;s almost non-existence. You can&#39;t even call it a tomato sauce because it tasted more like watered down ketchup. The rice is just regular steamed rice, not fried rice. The whole dish is so bland and awful.<br><br>~ BBQ Pork on Lard Rice ~<br>The only edible dish. Char Siu (BBQ pork) is okay, not too fat not too lean, just about right. You can get better Char Siu outside though. The soy sauce that comes with it tasted odd, it&#39;s not the sweet soy sauce you&#39;d normally get, it&#39;s too sweet. But overall it&#39;s a decent dish.<br><br>~ Teddy Bear Lemon Tea ~<br>The teddy bear ice looks cute and very instagrammable. The mould must be really well made, as the bear comes out with detailed furry texture. The tea base tasted so bland, it&#39;s watered down tea. It only came with 2 thin pieces of lemon that doesn&#39;t really add much flavour. Making a hella good HK style lemon tea can be very complicated, involving 3 different steps of making the tea base including a technique of pouring the tea between the two pots back and forth for several times. But the most simple, direct way of making one is simply brew some ceylon tea from a tea bag, then add a lot of lemon slices and syrup, and they still managed to screw that up. How can they charge such a simple drink for $8? Pretty sure that ice mould is made in China and worth less then $1 when made in bulk.<br><br>~ Coconut Grass Jelly Freeze ~<br>Turns out, a drink can still go wrong even if it&#39;s coming straight from a can. It tastes like watered down coconut milk. Charging us $7 for a watered down drink, that&#39;s ridiculous. We had 1 sip and never touched the drink again.<br><br>Will I be back? NO<br>No I&#39;m not sorry for the harsh review, it&#39;s just my honest opinion that the food/drinks we ordered are a disgrace to Hong Kong cuisine. Perhaps there are other dishes that tasted good, since they do have a large menu. But after trying 3 out of 4 items that came out wrong, I don&#39;t feel adventurous enough to try again. <br><br>If you are a born &amp; raised HongKonger and actually found some of the dishes good, feel free to comment and persuade me, but I doubt this will happen lol", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": 2674, "reviewCount": 300, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "8/7/2023", "comment": {"text": "This cafe blew up on social media recently and I have been waiting for the hype to die down before visiting.

I had seen so many great reviews at this restaurant, both for the food and the ambience. There was a bouncer at the door checking IDs which was a little odd for a restaurant but I guess it&#39;s not the best area on a Saturday night. We stopped in for dinner with a group of 6 for a stag night. Our server was Liv and she was amazing, we&#39;ll revisit her later in this review.<br><br>The menu offerings for food and beverages were both extensive and appealing from top to bottom. There weren&#39;t many options we didn&#39;t intrigue us, and to that effect, there weren&#39;t many dishes that we didn&#39;t order. Suffice to say, we ordered everything.<br><br>Appetizers-<br>Dumplings - chicken/pork belly was perfectly juicy and salty with the added fat from the pork belly. Shrimp and scallion was a classic. We opted for the fried option for both, which meant deep fried rather than pan fried. I would have preferred the steamed.<br>Mushroom and truffle croquettes - the most decadent croquette. Perfect golden brown delicious on the outside, luscious and creamy on the inside.<br>Calamari - good fry, nice variety of squid pieces<br>Charred Octopus - tender on the inside, charred on the outside with a funky tangy salty salsa verde and black vinegar sauce<br>Mussels - the broth and the pea shoots were the star of this dish for me. mussels were a nice accompaniment<br><br>Noodles/Rice-<br>Lobster noodles - this was as decadent of a dish as the croquettes. the combination if lobster and beurre blanc was one I didn&#39;t know I needed in a noodle dish.<br>Glass noodles - tough to get everything mixed together with the glass noodles a little overcooked but all the components were delicious and had a nice spice to the dish.<br>Bacon/shrimp fried rice - great side dish. classic fried rice dish<br><br>Entrees-<br>African chicken - juicy tender half chicken, resembles a classic piri piri chicken with an east asian twist<br>Duck breast - arguably the odd dish out of the menu selection but who doesn&#39;t love a perfectly seared duck breast. Part of me wished this was served like a peking duck with a homemade pancake on the side but that probably wouldn&#39;t fit this setting.<br>Crispy whole fish - what a fun part of the dining experience. Our server Liv cleaned the fish table-side for service. She clearly had practice because the bones ended up bare and the fillets came out flawless.<br><br>Cocktails-<br>Mah Jong - great twist on the classic Manhattan cocktail. Probably my favorite of the night<br>Bashful maiden - another twist on a French gimlet. A little sweet but dangerously tasty<br>La Nora - half the table ordered one but everyone found this a little too spicy. very tantalizing green color to the drink<br>Sweet Jane - probably the sweetest drink on the menu but the most popular with the group. Probably because you don&#39;t realize the tequila pour at all. The pineapple slice was a nice garnish and I love a good shaken cocktail over ice pebbles.<br>Macao espresso martini - subtle spin on the classic staple. absolutely end your meal with one of these if you&#39;re a fan of the classic espresso martini. they also do a classic espresso martini if you prefer", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 4, "reviewCount": 38, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "11/7/2023", "comment": {"text": "One of the most interesting menus I&#39;ve seen in a long time.

I would recommend everything we ordered because it was delicious, but the Mushroom and Truffle Croquettes had to be the best croquettes I&#39;ve ever had in my life... and I&#39;ve had many. <br><br>I would highly recommend if you&#39;re in the area!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 5}, {"photoCount": 4839, "reviewCount": 1618, "eliteYear": 2023, "localizedDate": "1/28/2023", "comment": {"text": "Ordered:<br>Shrimp &amp; Scallion Dumplings (~$15 each): 1 fried &amp; 1 steamed<br>Dozen Oysters (~$48): with leche de tigre mignonette<br>Mushroom Croquettes (~$16): with gruyere and parmesan<br>Sichuan Eggplant (~$15): with hoisin<br>Baby Bok Choy (~$14): with garlic<br>Fried Rice (~$15): with shrimp<br>Grilled Skirt Steak (~$36): bok choy, crispy potatoes<br>Macanese Lobster Noodles (~$48): shanghai noodles, kale, chili beurre blanc<br><br>Aya&#39;s take:<br>Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the rustic and dim ambiance. It&#39;s quiet in here; great for intimate dinners but we can by as a party of 7. Macao blends Chinese &amp; Portuguese flavors and although I love that combination, the entrees could have used more flavor. The appetizers were all delicious! From the freshness of the oysters to the crunchiness &amp; softness of the croquettes to the deliciously fried dumplings (way better than the steamed). Their Fried Rice is so simple yet tasty. And the Sichuan Eggplant is an absolute must! The Macao Lobster Noodles had 2 lobster tails but the noodles lacked flavor and were a bit too soupy for my liking. The Grilled Skirt Steak was cooked to a nice medium and the crispy potatoes complemented it so well. However, the bok choy wasn&#39;t seasoned (unlike the side which had a garlic flavor).

Start. There was a long wait on a dead Sunday as we waited outside we kept seeing people leaving. We \u00a0asked about seating for 4 but they said they were booked or full. Really? I think we were the only ones waiting. Kitchen was closing soon so maybe they wanted us to leave. The hostess was a bit rude about it which should have been the first sign to go somewhere else. Kept checking back and I believe a tall built gentlemen who may have been security kept reminding the hostess &#34;what about them&#34; (referring to us waiting), He was nice so we appreciated him and the reason we didn&#39;t leave. <br>We finally sat knowing the kitchen was closing at 9pm it took FOREVER for our waitress to come. To find out it look like only ONE waitress was working. \u00a0The waitress finally reached our table and she was quite rough around the edges and aggressive. She was the one that had the shaved head and black large rimmed glasses. While placing our order, one was beef tacos, \u00a0she rudely said with her voice \u00a0&#34;I would never eat the beef taco from here&#34; wait, what?!?! Why?!?! \u00a0She said &#34;I&#39;m just saying I would never eat their tacos&#34;. Ok you are scaring \u00a0me because I&#39;m ordering the steak fajitas so you making me think there is something wrong with the meat. &#34;I didn&#39;t say that... I said I would never eat their \u00a0beef taco&#34; oomph she said it like she wanted to fight me. I still ordered their beef taco. She left and it took 25 minutes to get water. The location is not big at all and by this time folks are leaving. Our food all came at once after a long wait \u00a0(including the appetizer) which we could not enjoy. Food was good. My friend ordered a drink which was wrong and the waitress came to the table and her attitude was like there was nothing wrong with the drink but something wrong with my friends tastebud. She asked about my drink and I said the pina colada (on the rocks) tasted like pineapple juice and cheap vodka and the virgin pine colada was more like pineapple juice. She then responded &#34;well if you had a problem with it you should have sent it back&#34;. I responded we were very thirsty and had nothing else to drink and she responded &#34;oh well too bad&#34;. What?!?!?! \u00a0 If she was more informative with the drinks than with the food I might have just gotten a coke but wait maybe if we got water I would have been able to send the fake pina colada back. We were done eating and waited a while for our check. While waiting I think it was another waitress who appeared from no where and was making out slobbing \u00a0down with her man by the large table next to the bar. Excuse me we want to leave?!? And you are giving us a show with 2 kids under 10 right there looking at y&#39;all. And no they could not look away because the way they were seated it was looking at the bar <br>Our waitress came we told them how unprofessional that was for their staff to be putting on a PDA show and she also agreed that was unprofessional. She gave us our bill which we split. To be honest the service was more worse then what I describe so I only felt she deserved the &#34;forced&#34;<br>lower end of her tip ( my portion of the the bill was less than 100) so she was lucky she got 18 dollars. When my friend paid her end, my friend did not think she should get a 2nd tip from what I already tipped. The waitress then said &#34;was there a problem with the service&#34;. But it was the way she said it. So aggressive rude and like she wanted to fight her. My friend responded &#34;didn&#39;t my friend give you a tip from the bill&#34;. The waitress said it was the tip for her end of the bill. Ok then you got a tip. However \u00a0the waitress kept badgering her saying but it was her bill with her tip. She was relentless and did not let it go that she deserves a tip. So we gave her 5 dollars. The only reason we did was because we did not want a full fledge argument because we had kids with us and they started to look at us on a verge of arguing. To be honest tipping is not mandatory. You get what you get and you don&#39;t get upset. The waitress was aggressive argumentative rude and lacked professionalism. We felt bullied into a tip and I know some may say &#34;I wouldn&#39;t have tipped or walked away&#34; but when you are with two kids the last thing you want to do is argue with someone that was looking for a fight. <br>Anywho I rarely post any negative comments on this as I use this platform to promote business not waste my time giving negative reviews. But this one I could not let it go. I should have stuck with my gut and NOT waste car fare both ways to go to stone street and go to this restaurant that my friend highly recommended as she use to be a regular and mentioned she knew the owner.

Instead, he kept on talking to her and asked her for her name and introduced himself as Ali. His coworker realized that I was waiting and he tried to get his attention multiple times so that he could ring me up but instead of acknowledging his coworker, he ignored him and continued his conversation.

There are several slices of flank steak, which is a bit tough, and a beef ball split in half that tasted pretty average like the ones you could get from supermarket. My beef ball have a huge tendon that I can&#39;t chew through and have to spit it out. They give you a bow of sprouts and Thai basil that you can add into the broth. Served also with wedges of lime, I squeezed it into my bowl occasionally to freshen up the palette.<br><br>~ Tet Noodle (4/5) ~<br>I genuinely enjoyed this dish! The garlic butter is creamy and flavourful, the black pepper added a hint of spice to it. The noodle have an okay texture, it&#39;s on the softer side, perhaps it would be even better if it&#39;s a bit more springy? It&#39;s topped with some crab meat, which to be honest I don&#39;t taste a lot of crab flavour when mixed together with the noodle as the sauce overpowered it. The shrimps that come with it are quite fresh and bouncy.<br><br>~ Suon Kho (2/5) ~<br>Pretty disappointed in the flavour of this dish. Whilst the spare pork ribs are quite flavourful, it tasted like a Chinese dish, I couldn&#39;t get any coconut flavour from the sauce and it&#39;s quite underwhelming. The pork ribs are also not tender enough. There are chunks of pineapple there which is nice, adding some sweetness to the savoury pork. <br><br>~ Fresh Coconut (5/5) ~<br>I&#39;m so glad they gave fresh coconut!!! It tasted very fresh and sweet, with strong coconut flavour! <br><br>Will I be back? Probably yes<br>Overall, the food is good although it did not wow me.

For our main meal we decided to share the Linguine a la Truffe, Cote de Boeuf with a side of truffle fries and creamed spinach. The steak we got cooked medium was delicious, especially with the sauces they paired with it. Only recommendations we have are more sauce needed to be added to the linguine because it was very dry and the creamed spinach needed some work. We did not love the taste at all. During our meal they gave us some bread and butter, the butter was delicious. We continued the night with some cocktails, I got the Chouchout (watered down), and then we decided to get 3 bottles of Veuve Clicquot Rose. Each bottle was $280.00, and they brought out the bottle like they were serving us water.

You can actually see pieces of crab meat mixed into the dip. <br><br>Mussels with chorizo - there is enough spice and pieces of chorizo with lots of mussels. <br><br>Deluxe french dip - the dish came with two sandwiches. It is cut really thin, which made it taste really good and not chewy. The dipping sauce was full of flavor. <br><br> Not realizing the meat was not cooked all the way, I had requested the waitress to send one of the sandwiches back to put in the oven a bit longer bc I&#39;m preggo. \u00a0 The waitress took it back but management came over asking what is wrong with it. We explained that I couldn&#39;t have raw meat due to pregnancy. They were not able to heat just one sandwich alone, rather they needed to heat both or we have to order a whole new separate one. She further explained how it&#39;s similar to ordering a steak; where u can&#39;t heat half a steak to well done. \u00a0BUT the thing that boggled me was, the sandwiches were two separate pieces and a steak is one whole piece!! Of course u can heat half a steak.

Let me start by saying, THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO GRAB A QUICK LUNCH. THIS IS AN AFTERWORK MEAL, HANGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, TREATING A CLIENT TO A MEAL SPOT. The flow of service is so slow. Each time I&#39;ve come here on lunch break, i&#39;ve spent at least 1:15 minutes inside, and 20 minutes of that was spent rushing to eat everything to get back to work. <br><br>The service here is friendly but it can be slow and awkward at times. The communication between the customer and waitstaff \u00a0is something to work on as they haven&#39;t informed my party, on the several occasions we&#39;ve dined here, of prices for their weekly specials which change or that there&#39;s an additional charge for items, I.e if you request for more bread that&#39;s $3 not free, if you ask for sour cream, you&#39;ll receive a 1.5 oz ramekin and that&#39;s $3, too. I could&#39;ve complained about these charges but I was afraid the language barrier might get in the way and don&#39;t want to cause any drama because things may get lost in translation. <br><br>Apart from the surprise charges, the staff have very friendly personalities and I&#39;ve noticed play multiple roles in the restaurant. <br><br>However, I&#39;ve experienced my dessert order being forgotten and waited over 15 minutes for it but my dining mate received there&#39;s 2 minutes after putting their order in. Or if drinks are ordered from the bar, depending on who&#39;s tending, they&#39;ll bring drinks out one at a time, instead of all at once. It&#39;s my hope that the wait team becomes more use to the flow of service and things will improve. \u00a0(Again, not saying their terrible but the communication and wait time for drinks and food is crazy) <br><br>The food itself, when you do receive it is delicious! The dishes have been coming out less than fresh made hot, almost warm depending on the dish, but their Pork chops (Chuleta), Salmon, nachos, dishes are amazing.

The nacho platter was so beautifully decorated but it&#39;s definitely not bar nacho portion which I&#39;m used to. I wouldn&#39;t consider it enough to share. Incredibly delicious, as are the other dishes offered but &#34;small&#34;. <br><br>Also, their drinks are actually small, compared to their competition and just in the industry, the highball glasses with drinks stuffed with ice and then beverage, while mixed just fine, I don&#39;t bother anymore. <br><br>The ambiance, is nice, wood tables, glass windows and doors. <br><br>Overall, I wouldn&#39;t want to come here for a lunch break. Maybe a date that you want to treat to a nice evening and be bougie.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to seem too negative but I personally wouldn&#39;t come back although the food here is great! 4/5 for the food but the portions and price make me hesitant.

Despite having reserved outdoor seating, and having arrived second (only one other party on site before us), we were seated at the non-booth table in the street without heaters. (There are 2 rows of booths and only 2 non-booth tables on the street.) \u00a0I asked to be seated at a heated booth table, but was immediately rejected. As we browsed the menu and waited for our food, we watched a party of 2 being seated at a two-person booth table, and another party of 2 being seated at a four-person booth table. \u00a0 <br><br>It was also getting chilly, so while we were waiting for our appetizers, I asked again if we could switch to a heated two-person booth table right across from us. The server checked with the manager, but came back to us to say &#34;no&#34; because &#34;another party is arriving soon.&#34; \u00a0<br><br>When our 6PM dinner came to a close at 7:30 PM, the heated booth table across from us was still empty. \u00a0However, even as we paid the bill, neither the server nor the manager bothered to explain the empty heated table or apologize to us. \u00a0<br><br>Is it just a coincidence that the only two Asian women in the restaurant were seated at the crappiest table, while all other white guests who arrived later were seated in heated booths? Is it just a coincidence that nobody bothered to say to the only two Asian women, &#34;sorry that you literally finished your dinner staring at the empty table across from you that you kept asking for?&#34;<br><br>When I demanded to talk to the manager (coincidentally, a white male), he came out with an attitude, clearly irritated that we even brought up this issue, and responded that the tables were for the regulars. He emphasized that the regulars want heated booth tables, and that he didn&#39;t understand why we thought our table was worse than the other tables. \u00a0Clearly, Majorelle isn&#39;t interested in making any other customers their new regulars, and its Managers don&#39;t understand that heated booths seem like better tables for customers who feel cold.<br><br>After saying the word &#34;regular&#34; repeatedly, the manager finally explained that he said no to our earlier requests because the particular regulars who wanted the same table had called the restaurant to tell them that they were running late. \u00a0Had he realized that they were running this late, he would have let us switch. <br><br>Now, ASSUMING all of the Manager&#39;s allegations are true (that all other white customers that night were regulars, except for us, the two Asian women; that the non-present regulars kept calling to say they were running late that night but would arrive eventually; that the regulars have a standing reservation for better tables over other reservation guests), I am still personally offended from these two points: <br><br>(1) someone should have explained or apologized to us IN ADVANCE of us paying our bill. We had explicitly asked twice to switch to the other table but were denied, while we watched everyone else get seated at heated tables, and the table we requested, literally within our sight, remained empty the entire time.

In retrospect, kale is a good base for a poke bowl because it does not get soggy like lettuce does, and can definitely hold its own against the fish and seaweed salad! I got to sample some of the tuna and hamachi, and both were exceptionally fresh and delicious! I personally would have preferred a little bit more sauce on the fish, but the light seasoning certainly emphasized the freshness of the fish. <br><br>I&#39;m really excited that they also have Hawaiian barbecue...

Every dining experience should be this hospitable. \u00a0Relaxing, delicious, elegant, and fresh. It&#39;s been a challenge finding really fresh sushi during the Pandemic. At Maki Kosaka, this is the fun way to eat sushi. Known for their grab hand roll, where you literally grab it off the plate and eat it with your hands. They provide a packet of seaweed according to your number of pieces. They ensure there&#39;s exactly enough for the meal. I just love the way they are packaged and displayed tableside. Notable mention: the chef that prepares your meal never changes and he/she is at your service during the experience. The dining room manager is also part of the hospitable service so I found her to be very informative during the meal if we had questions.<br><br>I ordered the Matsu Set A and my Dining buddy ordered the Set B. Both menu sets come with premium choice pieces and a great combination of flavors. I was most pleasantly surprised by the options (some premium) in the sets.

Each one plated beautifully and I made the mistake of eating off the serving plate instead of the dinner plate provided. Oops! I realized my folly after another table was seated across and I noticed how they grabbed their pieces off the red plate and ate off the white. It all made sense ... Plus this way the sushi chef can reach and plate the next item while we&#39;re eating the present item. Ha ha sharing my story so don&#39;t repeat. Uni was hands down my favorite, King crab was amazing, and I really enjoyed the flavors of each piece in itself - get the Foie! This brings me to the point of eating sushi this way, you get to enjoy each one. Unlike a regular restaurant where everything is on one plate. The flow of the meal, the order it&#39;s served and the garnishes on each, phenomenal.<br><br>Another lovely finish to our meal was the dessert. I ordered the matcha almond toffee. It was bagged in cello and boxed when it arrived at the table. A smaller portion of it was plated for us as well. The idea was you could take the dessert to go as you&#39;re likely not eating it all in one sitting.

The latter is more sleek and spacious, with leather booths and chairs and a large bar area.<br><br>The service is attentive and helpful, with servers explaining how to order your dry pot and offering suggestions on what to pair it with. You can also order some appetizers and drinks from a separate menu. The servers will also bring you bowls of rice (white or brown) and plastic gloves (to protect your fingers from the heat).<br><br>The dry pot is the star of the show. You can choose from four sizes (small to extra large) and four spice levels (mild to extra spicy). You can also choose from a variety of meats, seafood, vegetables, tofu products, mushrooms, noodles and more. Each ingredient has a different price depending on its weight. The fun part is mixing and matching your ingredients to create your own flavor combination. You can go for classic choices like beef slices, lotus root, enoki mushroom or potato noodles; or try something more adventurous like duck blood, pig brain, beef tripe or konjac noodles.<br><br>The result is a sizzling platter of colorful ingredients that are coated with a fragrant sauce that has a complex balance of heat, sweetness, sourness and saltiness. The sauce also has a numbing effect that makes you crave more bites even as your mouth burns.<br><br>Mala Project is for those who enjoy interactive dining or solo indulging.

The Raita was basically just yogurt with maybe a shake of some spice mixed it, no cucumber or anything else. <br><br>But the entrees, thumbs down all the way.

It&#39;s a bit pricey for 4 sticks of meat, but its really good.<br><br>BEEF SATAY: ($6.95) Sweeter and a bit drier than the chicken, but still very tasty, the beef satay is red and reminds me of a thin Chinese char tsiu (BBQ roast pork) on a stick. This also comes as 4 sticks of meat, with peanut sauce. This was tasty as well.<br><br>ROTI CANAI: ($4.25) 1 deliciously flaky roti paired with spicy chicken curry with sharp notes of ginger.

While they haven&#39;t braised it well enough to have it fall apart in your mouth, it is still fairly soft.

With generous slivers of mango and tender chicken in a goopy translucent sauce, the mango chicken helped balance out the spiciness and the prominent flavors of the rendang and chicken curry.<br><br>NASI LEMAK: ($11.50) Meaning fatty rice in Malay, this dish is known for being paired with rice cooked in coconut milk.

Delivery is extremely prompt and everything is packaged very well. We have by no means worked our way through the menu. When we find \u00a0something.we like we stick with it until we feel the need to try something new. Here it is the description of what we have had. First the roti Cani is indeed delicious, the roti light and fluffy the dip spicy and excellent. But then we moved on to the Crystal dumplings. The assorted ones. Besides, the dipping sauce, a little touch of Sambal Olek gives the dumplings a zing, and they&#39;re actually quite filling. Then on to the satay. Which has a problem. The chicken is easy to eat but not the beef way too hard. Peanut sauce delicious. My advice order the chicken \u00a0 Then onto the soup. the Malaysian shrimp broth was tasty, but could&#39;ve been a bit stronger in flavor. The regular seafood soup was too full of extremely chewy things. Then on to that Tom Yum. That is excellent. No matter how you order it. It&#39;s spicy enough aromatic and delicious. And is it filling. On to the entr\u00e9es. Beef rendang used to be a favorite and it is enormous , but it can be a little heavy. Chicken randang \u00a0is dark meat chicken we like white meat. Shrimp with mango , Pineapple is always great. Although a little sweet, but it does have some spice and double wonder is also a great dish a little lighter. The chow kush teoh despite some rave reviews. wasvis a very big disappointment. There was very little sauce and noodles were very greasy and not much flavor. Would-not order it again. Actually afraid to order any noodle dish because fear they&#39;re all drenched with grease. The regular curry, beef and curry chicken. found to be not ll what we expected. nothing wrong with it, but more used to the Indian curries just a matter of taste. Have not tried the curry mee soup. But afraid we are spoiled with the Tom Yum. Have avoided the dishes that seemed to be typically Chinese. Chinese dishes we order from Szechuan or hunan restaurants. We go to Malaysia Grill for Thai food. There are many dishes here we have not tried, but the ones that we have and we liked strongly recommend. We have found when. ordering on the upper West side, if you find dishes you like it&#39;s wise to stick with them. Whatever you order, do not forget to get the ginger ice tea.

I&#39;m having another go at our leftovers post bedtime for the kids -- and I&#39;m appreciating afresh just what a godsend Malaysia Grill is to our neighborhood. If you&#39;re from Singapore or Malaysia, you&#39;d do best to skip; this place will inevitably fall short of what the foodie-saturated homeland is capable of producing. But if you&#39;re an uncultured, pedestrian New Yorker like me, run there as fast as you can. <br><br>For New York and for our neighborhood, Malaysia Grill is shockingly good, especially for the price point. In many places in the US, it would be destination dining. \u00a0<br><br>The chow kueh teow was tender and smoky, made with broad rice noodles cooked to a perfect texture, and balanced by a perfect proportion of well-prepared small shrimp, squid and onion. I&#39;ve attempted the dish myself and have a deep appreciation for those who can achieve that perfect silky, tender, but non-mushy rice noodle texture. <br><br>The roti canai was a thing of beauty, impossibly flakey and buttery, evocative of an excellent croissant, flattened. The non-wimpily spiced chicken-potato stew that accompanied the roti was another successful harmonization of numerous food cultures. <br><br>Our kids enjoyed the sesame fried tofu main though I found the dish overly sweet. One cubic inch tofu cubes were fried -- I think battered in something -- to a crisp, substantial (read: chewy, meat-like) texture, then tossed with a sweet, savory, sticky brown sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds. A good portion of well-made broccoli came with this dish. <br><br>There were also positive reviews among the kids for the satay beef and chicken. Both were made tender and mild, fairly sweet. <br><br>&#34;Thai curry samosas&#34; were crispy little triangles filled with a spicy potato-based filling. This was evocative of both the &#34;kare / curry puffs&#34; I loved as a child and the &#34;party&#34; samosas my partner and I look forward to at every auntie&#39;s holiday party -- so it was probably the perfect representation of what modern Malaysia is. We eschewed the weirdly syrupy, gloppy orange sauce, but enjoyed the samosas / fried filled-dough triangles by themselves or with the coconut, tomato, and cilantro chutneys we already had on hand. <br><br>Nasi goreng was surprisingly authentic, complete with some funky umami-rich anchovy sambal. We loved the satisfying crunch and acid that the pickled cucumber and cabbage added to the dish, the fresh tomato. Coconut rice had but a hint of coconut flavor, less intense than our experienced norm when eating Malaysian food in Singapore (the closest we&#39;ve come to Malaysia). I enjoyed the more nuanced and delicate flavors of this preparation, though, and that it tempered the bolder, louder ingredients, like sambal anchovies. <br><br>Perhaps the only real personal disappointment of the evening food-wise were the popiah. Versions I&#39;ve enjoyed in Singapore, Xiamen and other places included julienned fried / baked tofu, omelet, scallions, etc..., which were less moist and unidimensional, and more substantial than Malaysia Grill&#39;s version. To be fair, popiah fillings vary widely across regions -- but this version just didn&#39;t do it for me. Although the pan-cooked wrapper was originally tender, soft, and lovely, the vegetables within quickly soaked through, making the rolls structurally unstable. <br><br>Wonderful delivery option to stumble upon.

Immediately to the right as you walk in, staff members roast and chop rows upon rows of rotisserie chicken. Plexiglass panels separate the queue for indoor dining from the seating area. The line runs along a wide bar, equipped with refrigerated foods, ingredients for mixed drinks, dishes and glasses illuminated by blue backlighting, and heated trays of preprepared menu items. A wavy dropdown ceiling hangs above the dining area. Granite tables and light grey cushioned booths are pressed up against brick walls with exposed woodwork, themselves decorated with colorful murals.

Staff members, each donning a branded Malecon polo, dash around the restaurant like clockwork.<br><br>During my first visit, I opted for the Mofongo de Chicharron de Cerdo and the Mondongo Pequeno (small tripe soup), and the food was quickly ushered out on simple porcelain dishware. The mofongo was a softball-sized lump of vaguely sweet, noticeably dry crushed plantains mixed with plenty of shredded pork pieces. Based on my experiementation, the mofongo was overpowered by hot sauce but enhanced greatly by a dash of added salt and by the dark, rich, soup-like sauce served in a separate bowl. The remainder of the plate was filled with two small chunks of dry chicharrones and the saddest salad ever (two sliced tomatoes atop a bed of shredded lettuce). The &#34;small&#34; mondongo was a surprisingly large bowl, filled generously with a fragrant, bright orange broth, many slices of tender tripe, and a few chunks of soft potatos. I dipped the complimentary buttered and toasted bread into this soup with gusto.<br><br>On a return visit, I went with the Medio Pollo con Maduros. The chicken had deliciously seasoned, grilled skin, and the bananas were soft with a slightly caramelized crisp. Both were nicely complemented by the sweet and sour salsa verde. My own critique is that I wanted even more salsa!<br><br>On both visits, I arrived for solo lunch, and I was immediately seated. Service was friendly, albeit somewhat inattentive, particularly toward the end of the meal. Regardless of what you order, expect to be solidly full. At nearly $30 for the large but unimpressive mofungo, I wouldn&#39;t be a player again. But at just $15 for half of a stellar rotisserie chicken and a hefty plate of sweet plantains? Yes, please!

Her name is Alexia and she will go above and beyond for your dietary restrictions. Alexia&#39;s generosity and kindness goes a long way in my book. The cafe experience though could have been a lot better from an overall perspective. The tickets in total were $50 per person which includes the main dish that you have to order ahead of time. In total for two people that was $100. The photo ops were fun, but there definitely should have been more available for what you&#39;re paying for. We also bought two souvenirs per person (two people). All souvenir purchases totaled up to $108.88 The meal total came down to around $89-$90 and there is a $6 mandatory gratuity charge, which was fine. The overall experience though was definitely not worth all that money and the quality of the food wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. The total price of everything ultimately came around to $298.88. <br><br>Let me put this into perspective. You could go to a fancy steakhouse and order something nice for that price. You could save a ton of money only spending $50 for unlimited ice cream and a much better tour at the ice cream museum.

I have always wondered if I&#39;m missing out on Malibu Farm - they&#39;re always packed at brunch time on the weekends. Safe to say, no - I was not missing out on anything. <br><br>I saw there was an event for an Easter Egg Painting Event where a cocktail, dinner and the class was included for $98 ($213 for two people after tax), so I thought wow what a perfect opportunity to try their food while also participating in this cool activity. Note that a group workshop directly with Private Picassos is $60/student which leaves $38-50 dinner value assuming they got a large group deal for our 20 person class. This review will focus on Malibu Farm&#39;s food service and hospitality. <br><br>First off, there was no introduction to the event - no outline or schedule of the night, what to expect, reviewing what&#39;s included in the night, not even a time estimate of the event. The event description stated a cocktail was included with the event. When the server came over, he ONLY pointed to the limited cocktails on the top. I&#39;m pregnant (and pretty visibly so, might I add) and wanted to clarify if mocktails were available too but he kept disappearing before I could ask anything. I ended up ordering a virgin raspberry spritz. The drinks came out 30 minutes later and when I asked, &#34;Is that the virgin one?&#34; he stared at me like &#34;Oh, I&#39;m not sure. It must not be yours&#34; and went to the other end of the table. Moments later he came back and was like &#34;Raspberry spritz? Anyone, anyone?&#34; Clearly it was my drink but he had no idea what was in it. So clueless! I told him again, &#34;I ordered a virgin raspberry spritz earlier and I need to make sure there&#39;s no alcohol in that.&#34; He then responded, &#34;OK, I&#39;ll see if they can make it.&#34; Disappears for another 30 minutes. 1 hour into the event, I&#39;m finally given my drink. SMH, I was so untrusting of him I had my husband test try it before I drank it myself. My goodness. Had he just let me order a mocktail, that would&#39;ve been so much easier. Red flag: uninformed employees who clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re serving and to who.<br><br>Near the end of the event, waiters started coming around with appetizers - Impossible sliders, labne with celery, shrimp wrapped in bacon. My husband and I were so excited and like yay, dinner service is about to begin! Except that, what thought were appetizers WAS dinner. I cannot fathom how any company could advertise sliders, labne yogurt, and shrimps wrapped in bacon as dinner. The only food I got that night were 2 Impossible Sliders, 2 shrimps wrapped in bacon and 1 labne yogurt with celery and carrots. I felt bad since the couple in front of us didn&#39;t eat red meat so they had to request shrimp not wrapped in bacon and waited upwards of 25 minutes for it -- even after reminding them about it. <br><br>No one ended the event it just kind of... sputtered out. No &#34;thank you for coming, hope you had fun tonight&#34; no sense of closure. We weren&#39;t the only ones taken aback, as another couple asked a staff member if this was indeed the end and no actual dinner was going to be served. I was incredibly disappointed, as I feel I was misled by the event description. My husband ordered a beer and me a mocktail because we overheard others ordering multiple drinks. You have the audacity to hold me accountable to the one cocktail but not yourselves for the dinner portion? Also I would have appreciated a simple &#34;by the way, only one cocktail is included in the event - is that OK?&#34; before ordering. I would have been OK if they had said &#34;light bites will be served throughout the event&#34; that way expectations were not set. <br><br>Basically, be wary of Malibu Farm events and service.

The prices are very similar and surprisingly the portion size hasn&#39;t really changed either compared to the original with the only exception being that there isn&#39;t the happy hour specials for appetizers and drinks. The service here is very nice and I decided to order two dishes which I found to be very good at the other location. To drink I got a lychee Thai iced tea which was 4.50$. I find most places to make a too sugary Thai iced tea but this was much more subtle. There was a good amount of lychee flavor which wasn&#39;t overpowered by the tea and overall I enjoyed it. In terms of my food, I had the Chive Rice Cakes and Stewed Beef Basil.<br><br>A-15: Chive Rice Cake/Kanom gui chai tod: Crispy chive rice cake served with a sweet soy sauce (7.95$)<br><br>The portion size was nice and there was a fun chewy texture as expected from the dish. This works well as an appetizer but I would recommend it more if you are sharing as it gets a little bit heavy from the fry even with the soy sauce and the shredded carrots. Still tasty and nothing wrong at all.<br><br>M-1: Stewed Beef Basil/Pad Grapow/Phat kaphrao: Tender and flavorful stewed beef saut\u00e9ed with bell peppers and string beans in a spicy basil sauce (17.95$) <br><br>In terms of last time, the two dishes that stuck out the most in my head were this and the crispy pork belly prik khing and as I didn&#39;t want two fried dishes, I went with the former. This was just as good as the other place. The beef was remarkably tender but still with some texture and while I&#39;m not a big fan of bell pepper, the crunch went well (along with the crunch from the string beans.) The very tasty sauce as expected had a strong holy basil flavor and when you want a bit heavier of a kick, the jalapenos work. Overall I would change nothing. <br><br>I&#39;m hoping this place does well. The prices are as reasonable as any Thai place in the local area and the food is just better in some instances if the rest of the menu is presumably just as good as the beef basil.

To make matters worse, instead of the usual medley of vegetables like cabbage, they served it with lettuce, which is apparently better suited for salads and not meant to be cooked in soups.<br><br>On a brighter note, the pork sisig (4/5) was flavorful, smoky, and had a satisfying crunchy texture.

I had Filipino food before, but this was the first time since COVID-19 lockdown in NYC. I would recommend this place for first-timers.<br><br>LUMPIA - Filipino version of a spring roll made with pork and a side of sweet and sour dipping sauce. This was perfectly fried with a nice golden brown. My only thing is I wish they were skinnier like other lumpia&#39;s I have before so I get optimal crunch with the perfect amount of filling in one bite. <br><br>PORK SISIG with GARLIC RICE - Crispy chopped pork belly with onions &amp; chili paired with garlic rice. A guilty pleasure for sure. You get a flavor bomb of that tender pork belly and aromatic red onions with the crunch from the crispy bits of pork belly, which pairs so well with the fluffy garlic rice. The garlic rice is very subtle and not as pungent, which is a great canvas for the sisig. MUST ORDER! <br><br>PALABOK - The palabok is rice noodles coated in a thick pork and shrimp sauce topped with crispy chicharron and boiled egg. This was my first time trying palabok and did not know what to expect. It was an interesting dish because you first get hit with a bomb of shrimp and then get the different textures from the springiness of the thick rice noodles, creaminess of the pork and shrimp sauce, crispy bits of the chicharron, and a bit of tang from the lemon. This is definitely a rich dish and the portion could probably feed 3-4 people. <br><br>Will be returning to try the squid sisig, spaghetti with fried chicken, and halo halo next time. I have heard good things about those, but my eyes definitely were bigger than my belly because we had to pack half the noodles and a little bit of the sisig with rice.

And not to mention the wait staff is gorgeous! Our server was super friendly, patient and knowledgeable in regards to the food items on the menu. I wish I had taken her name down. <br><br>We ordered from their brunch menu and the regular roll menu and let me tell you the portions where generous but most importantly the food was excellent. I had the challah French toast with strawberry butter OMG that&#39;s all I can say. The bread was so crisp on the outside soft on the inside almost like it was caramelized . Cooked to perfection with a little drizzle of syrup, yumm. My sister ordered the Japanese Souffle style pancakes with berry marmalade and raisin ice cream. HEAVEN! the mixture of sweet cream, tardiness and sweetness of the berries and the softness of the pancake, money maker right there. My son ordered the steak and eggs that came with roasted mini potatoes. \u00a0I&#39;m a vegetarian but did sneak in some of the potato and let me tell you they had a creamy texture but so well seasoned I would eat a whole plate of just potato. <br><br>Lastly we each ordered one roll each and was plated all together in one huge tray. We ordered the Mamajuana, El Campesino, Jack Veneno, Tre Golpe, Lobster and steak and I belive the Merengue, I know it had some shrimp in it.

The Souffle pancakes weren&#39;t fluffy and puffed like i imagined. They were flat. <br>2.Their brunch menu only consisted of &#34;breakfast&#34; items. Here in CT brunch means a whole ass meal for a good price. From appetizers, to beverage, to the meal and a dessert. Mamasushi only offered the one item as a BRUNCH item.<br>3.

Also they had some nice artwork on the walls and had a lot of lighting which I like. I hate eating in dark places. Our waiter was Kalvin and he was nice and took care of us his suggestions were on point and I enjoyed my meal very much. Let&#39;s talk about the food which to me is very important. So for appetizers we had the tostones and the fried calamari. So they were both very good and I enjoyed them. The calamari was fried well not over or under and the sauces were also very good. The tostones were done well and the shrimp and beef were a good amount. Then for the entree I had the yucafongo with Churrasco. This was quite delicious and could easily been shared with two people but I&#39;m greedy and I ate the whole thing. The yuca was cooked perfectly and was fried and then inside it had the pieces of churrasco. The beef was cooked well and was very flavorful. I did think the churrasco would come on the side and not sliced up inside the yucafongo but I enjoyed it very much. As I write this I am thinking of this dish and how much I enjoyed it. My friend had the fried whole snapper and they liked their dish. I do think it would have been beneficial for them to have some pickled onions or something on the fish but that&#39;s because I like a salsa to accompany my fried foods. But they loved their food and finished it all. For my drinks I had a passion colada and I enjoyed it very much the right balance of liquor and you could taste both the passion fruit and the colada. Tip was already included and we each paid about 77.00 each. I did not think that was bad we ate a good amount of food it was tasty, each had a drink and two appetizers which we all three shared.

AND IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO KICK ONE CUSTOMER OUT FOR OVERSTAYING THEIR WELCOME, KICK EVERYONE ELSE OUT TOO. The 1 star is because there was one particular employee who was ruuuuuude. The drinks, food &amp; ambience is good otherwise.<br><br>First of all, I&#39;m going to start by saying I have loved Maman for years. I&#39;ve long been a loyal customer at their other locations. However, today -- one of the employees at this location made me feel extremely unwelcome and I am extremely disappointed. It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t like your job, just don&#39;t take it out on your customers.<br><br>Today was the 2nd time I went to the King location. The first time, I went for a quick brunch hangout. Today, I set aside the whole day to work at this location because it&#39;s the perfect work spot -- chill vibes, good food &amp; drinks, the place is full of outlets. It&#39;s set up to be a work spot, they kindly give you free wifi as well.<br><br>But apparently, there is a 90 minute limit per table. I was unaware of this. So 2 hours into having a pleasant stay there, I was kicked out from the original table I was seated. If is the case -- THIS POLICY NEEDS TO BE MADE CLEAR: either orally, written on paper clearly displayed, or both. There were plenty of other people who were there longer than us, and they didn&#39;t get kicked out. So I guess it was a table specific thing, since we were seated at the most instagrammable spot? Again, just make your policies consistent. Kick me out? Kick everyone else out.<br><br>So the employee who approached my friend and I was clearly having a bad day. I&#39;m not even sure she&#39;s aware of how awful she came across. She approached us wanting us to completely leave the premises -- who does that?!!! And played the &#34;I was kind enough to let you stay longer&#34; card. Maybe be competent enough to communicate clearly at the beginning instead and not ruin someone&#39;s day and workflow? There were plenty of empty tables too. So it wasn&#39;t until I asked her whether I could move to another table because we were literally in the middle of work, that she agreed and let us move. I even purchased more food because I intended to stay there the whole day.<br><br>But it was unfair and extremely unpleasant to feel like it was our fault when we were never told this policy. So fast forward to when they closed (we didn&#39;t know they closed at 4pm -- that&#39;s clearly not our job to keep tabs on). The same employee SLAMS her cleaning bottle on the table I was at. It was 4:07pm. Y&#39;all need to work on your communication skills. Tell your customers at 3:55pm that you close at 4, instead of being rude 7 minutes after your close time.<br><br>Yeah, yikes.

I hadn&#39;t been putting much thought into my bites, but before I knew it I had run out of everything but potatoes. I was making sure to get a bit of potatoes with every bite, so to have basically half the dish be left and only be potatoes was surprising. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find someone who loves potatoes as much as me, but even that was a bit much for me. I think if the ingredient ratio is changed, this dish could be much better.

While Yelp calls this laptop friendly and says they have free WiFi and the reviews describe plenty of outlets, they also have a no-laptop policy. If you search the reviews for &#34;laptop&#34; you&#39;ll see a lot of people complaining about this and the owner very patiently explaining the situation again and again. Frankly, it&#39;s not his fault. I think it&#39;s a crazy policy but I understand the reasoning. They want this to be a social place. A place to disconnect from media and reconnect with people. It&#39;s a nice idea. But people just spent 2 years forced to work and stay locked up in their own homes. People probably want to get out and about for their work day and this place is an adorable place to work. \u00a0But, it&#39;s the business policy so what can you do but not try to work here. <br><br>Yelp needs to do a better job. It&#39;s like when you search for &#34;vegan&#34; and a steakhouse comes up with nothing vegan and the only reason it came up is because one review said the word &#34;vegan&#34; as in, nothing vegan here. Similarly, all of these reviews mention laptops so Yelp brings it up in a laptop friendly search. Asinine. But again, not the businesses fault. Sometimes Yelp sucks. <br><br>Anyway, laptop rant aside, we really wanted to work here but couldn&#39;t, so we just had breakfast. I got a breakfast sandwich with chicken that was absolutely delicious and my fianc\u00e9 got their avocado toast and loved it. Coffees we&#39;re excellent too.

It always comes with a side of microgreens with a delicious dressing. This morning they brought the dish sans greens. So I nicely walked up to the counter and asked about the side of greens. The young woman at the counter asked the &#34;chef&#34; who is visible and he shook his head no. She came back to say &#34;he said no&#34; I pointed out that it clearly states on the menu that it comes with greens and I&#39;ve also ordered this dish at least 20x at various locations. <br>Basically, they could care less and brushed me off. While I&#39;m at it, I should mention that this was around 10AM and the bathroom trash was over flowing and there was no soap in the bathroom. Gross. I almost posted a couple weeks ago about a different experience where an employee was wearing gloves but wiped his nose, touched his cell phone and face and the proceeded to prepare drinks. Again, pretty gross. Everyone was so nice that day that I decided not to post. Unfortunately, after today and the attitude of the employees I figured I&#39;d share it all. My suggestion is to be consistent and have the employees familiar with how a dish is prepared, also it should go without saying that hygiene training should be implemented- and most of all, be nice to the customers that visit.

The attached picture is the bags she threw to the ground outside of the store.<br><br>I&#39;m positive that I acted politely all the way and followed the guidance to wait for a few more minutes before picking up. I wonder whether this hostile attitude is because it&#39;s a TGTG order and therefore the customer doesn&#39;t deserve any minimal respect? I feel lucky that I didn&#39;t use TGTG due to economic struggles but I&#39;m sure there are people who are trying to save a few bucks via this APP. This type of condescending behavior is probably more humiliating for them given they didn&#39;t have better options. <br><br>I accidentally recorded the conversation outside of the store when the staff threw the bags to the floor (I was taking pics of my dog while waiting), in case the business owner needs to see a proof of this incident. <br><br>To the business owner: I know TGTG is not a huge source of revenue or profit, but I imagine it&#39;s one way to acquire new customers. I was not impressed at all and will definitely not visit again. If you are doing this to save food waste, please let you staff show minimal respect to customers. No matter why they are using the service, they do not deserve to be treated as such - having to pick up food that&#39;s thrown to the ground by your staff???! \u00a0It&#39;s a shame. <br><br>To this staff \u00a0if you happen to see this review: no matter what reasons contributing to your unhappiness and bad temper, you don&#39;t get to let it out on other people, customer or not.

The food at Maman is so good, and the coffee might be even better. There are several locations in the city and the one we went to didn&#39;t fact have a very long line however, it was worth every minute of waiting. When you&#39;re waiting in line, you really get the opportunity to take in the vibe of the restaurant, which is very unique. There are some people there meeting with friends there are some people there that look like they&#39;re part of a study group. There are couples there there are single people there there are people from all walks of life in one restaurant, enjoying the pastries, and the coffees that are made by the chefs. It&#39;s kind of an incredible blend of people and energy. While we waited in line, we also had the opportunity to walk past all of the delicious pastries which is genius because of course they look so decadent that you can&#39;t help but order at least one. If you do order one, I&#39;m here to tell you, you will not regret it. Everything is fairly fresh and the pastries we ordered were all flaky and flavorful and things that dreams are made of. <br><br>When I got to the front of the line though, I had had maybe 20 minutes to make up my mind there was still so many things I wanted and needed help and the cashier was happy to help guide me . I ended up ordering a avocado toast, which you might think it&#39;s basic and you&#39;re right, but this avocado toast was a step above your average avocado toast, and that every bite from start to finish packed flavor, and the bread was otherworldly. I also ordered a coffee of the cashiers choice. I really wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted. I gave them a little bit of information and they ordered for me which was the greatest decision because what I ended up with was a delicious but super caffeinated drink that would help get me through my NYC day. And finally we ordered the chocolate and pistachio croissant which I wasn&#39;t 100% sure about but got off of the recommendation of someone in line and I&#39;m so glad I listen to them because it was a huge level above just your standard chocolate croissant there was some salty and some crunch and plenty of chocolate. It was a perfect croissant. Lastly, the design on all of the cups, including the to go cups were so adorable that we took all of our to go cups and utilize them for the rest of the trip, and then went back and got permanent cops because we just fell in love with a design so much.

The nutty chocolate chip cookie is delicious and worthy of its reputation as one of the best in the city. The honey lavender latte is one of my go-to favorites being that it is so well-balanced and flavorful. But, it might be the iced jasmine pistachio latte that is my new favorite-- it actually tasted life changing! I wish I had taken a picture, but it was so delicious I devoured it in seconds. I wish it was around a lot longer!

I have to flag down a server to order my honey lavender latte. I get my latte and sit and journal.<br><br>45 minutes to an hour after I get my latte, the server gives me a cookie. That was a nice gesture that I appreciated. He also decided to offer me water at this point. I asked if the cookie had nuts in it and it did unfortunately. I told him I was allergic so I couldn&#39;t eat it.

Our plans weren&#39;t grand; we wanted to meander through the city in the post-blizzard state, eating and drinking as we walked from Times Square to an eventual destination in Chinatown. How optimistic!<br><br>By the time we hit \u00a0Broome and Bowery, we were tired and cold. The novelty of the plan had worn off; our feet were soaked from jumping through slushy crosswalks; we hadn&#39;t eaten in several hours; and I just wanted to be at the last bar we were aiming for. However, my ever-adventurous husband begged me to take a brief detour to Little Italy. Groaning and complaining the whole way, I dragged behind him through the neighborhood. Since I was being no help in selecting a spot, he spontaneously chose Mambo &#39;taliano, noticing the full bar in the back.<br><br>It was early in the evening (5 or 6) and there were a handful of tables seated. However, we headed straight for the bar and grabbed two stools by the piano. There was no live music that night, but an iPod was playing a wonderful blend of old-world Italian favorites mixed with new-world classics. The bartender--straight off the boat from Venice--immediately asked what we&#39;d like, and we chose a limoncello and a glass of white wine. When he produced the drinks moments later, he asked if we&#39;d like a menu. We hemmed and hawed, and said perhaps an appetizer, but then, in looking at the menu, found we couldn&#39;t make up our minds--so we asked him for a recommendation. What he brought us may have been even more delicious because of the cold, snowy night outside--but how can you go wrong with fried mozzarella and bread with marinara sauce? <br><br>As we enjoyed the appetizer, the manager strolled over to see how we were. We explained the bartender was great as was the food, and he asked why my husband was drinking simply limoncello. Moments later, he had the bartender make a limonsecco (limoncello and prosecco) for my husband and a signature martini for me. Both were delicious, and in our blissful state, we asked the bartender to order the best homemade pasta entree on the menu for us to share. We&#39;re glad we did, because the gnocchi that came out was melt-in-your-mouth amazing.

Not only did we have no issues with using our credit card, but we over-tipped in the end. Why? The limonsecco, house martini, and sambuca never even appeared on our bill.

I don&#39;t think this restaurant deserves 4 star but its not 3 star neither. I still gave them .5 credit for their service. Overall, I would not come back to this restaurant at all.

The $2 falafel sandwiches from the original, tiny, hole-in-the-wall on MacDougal, almost always consumed in Washington Park, kept me (and many others) from dying of malnourishment as a graduate student once upon a time. Today, those two dollar falafel sandwiches are a bit like penny candy or 24 cent packs of Wrigley&#39;s gum: It&#39;s kind of mind boggling these things were once real! <br><br>For years, my friends and I would go back for sandwiches for old time&#39;s sake, even though Taim was, for a time, just around the corner and of far-better quality. Mamoun&#39;s still had its charms. Sandwiches were stuffed with tiny falafel so crisp they were possibly double fried, with just enough iceberg lettuce and diced tomato to fend off scurvy. The falafel slinging staff were always sleep deprived, impatient and grouchy--but also gruffly kind. <br><br>These days, Mamoun&#39;s is a well established franchise -- there&#39;s even a location in Georgia! The 11th location is not far from us on the UWS. But the product is not anywhere near as enjoyable now as I remember it. There&#39;s a lot of new fangled stuff on the menu like schawarma and chicken kebabs, which didn&#39;t exist on the old menu. <br><br>When you compare apples to apples or falafel sandwiches to falafel sandwiches, I&#39;m not sure that evolution has been for the better. Sandwiches are made with the flimsiest pita -- factory made as far as I can tell, though there are claims on the website that Mamoun&#39;s bakes in house... definitely don&#39;t think these are fresh or housemade -- and I think exactly three small falafel. The space around the three little falafel balls is now stuffed to bursting with iceberg, tomatoes, onions, tahini and, if you request, free pickled radishes (good) and olives. <br><br>It&#39;s astonishing to me that I&#39;m complaining about having too many vegetables, but at New Mamoun&#39;s, the ratios are completely off, resulting in a structurally unsound pile of something that appears to be more like a salad bowl than a sandwich. When you unwrap the &#34;sandwich,&#34; you find half-melted pita dissolving into moist lettuce and watery tahini. It is possible to excavate the remains of a few tiny falafel from underneath the pile, but only with effort. <br><br>Sandwiches with meat have, in our experience, included moist, flavorful protein, but have the same structural flaws as their falafel filled counterparts. Fillings are distributed unevenly, so you&#39;ll eat a bite of all lettuce, then one of all onion, then one of all gyro meat, etc... <br><br>Will we be back? Probably. It&#39;s convenient, there&#39;s outdoor seating that&#39;s pleasant in warm weather, and prices are hard to beat in this neighborhood.

Nothing about their pizza was bad but then again nothing was particularly impressive. Everything tasted like it was fresh and made from quality ingredients.

The crust was great on all the slices but their Margarita and White slices had too few toppings. They were mostly bread.

It was the quintissential New York slice. It is thin, crispy at the end crust and chewy at the end. I loved the flavor of their cheese. <br><br>White (3/5): Their White Slice was good, but it simply didnt have enough cheese. There was hardly any ricotta and the mozzarella was well caramelized but the layer simply wasn&#39;t thick enough. It was mostly bread. I did enjoy their crust, but I wish they would increase the cheese to dough ratio. <br><br>Margarita Slice (3.5/5): Much like the last slice, the Margarita Slice was good, but the tomato sauce and mozzarella was spread too thin across the slice.

I had read other reviews talking about the pizza and I was craving some cheesy goodness so of course, I ordered the magherita. And yes, they make the ENTIRE PIZZA right in front of you! They have to mold the dough, flower it, they put the sauce on it, the toppings, and put it in the brick oven (points for this) right in front of you! LITERALLY, as fresh as fresh can be. The whole process does take some time though (which I found kind of annoying since I really wanted to be in and out). Waited in the store for about 30 minutes.<br><br>Although the pizza smelled fresh, it was very thin and the sauce wasn&#39;t to my liking. The cheese and sauce and everything was just a huge mess whenever I tried to pick up a slice (they cut it into 4). But.. the taste was not terrible and for $11, I would still give this experience 3 stars.<br><br>The next day, for the same reason, I came back and tried the penne alla vodka which is ordered at the same grill. This was made quickly, perhaps.. 5 minutes? This was a HUGE portion, and I probably could&#39;ve had it for lunch and dinner and still be famished! In a disappointing note, it did smell better than it taste but it was still delicious non the less.<br><br>Cheers to Mangia&#39;s redemption!", "language": "en"}, "rating": 4}, {"photoCount": 92, "reviewCount": 41, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "9/14/2019", "comment": {"text": "I have only had their catering in my office, but their sandwiches and cold pesto pasta salad with pine nuts is SO GOOD!

From the grill, I had the Grilled Branzino. It was served with two sides. I had the whipped cauliflower and mashed sweet potatoes. The Filet Mignon was so tender. It was served with mushrooms, roasted veggies and roasted fingerling potatoes. The dessert menu was just amazing. The pear tart was fabulous. The crust was flaky and the cream was superb. the NY cheesecake was fluffy and rich. The macarons were just fabulous. The vanilla\u00a0 and raspberry were so flavorful.

In the middle of the restaurant is a large cold bar full of salads (and not just of the healthy kale/quinoa variety, but things like pesto pasta salads as well), mixed veggies, fresh mozzarella, and a variety of meats. Pro tip: make sure you check out the hot items to the right of the salad bar - every day Mangia offers one type of hot pasta and one protein in addition to the cold bar, and the pasta has always been on point. I usually skip the hot protein item and beeline straight for the spot where I know ahi tuna usually resides, then peruse the salads.

I have patronized thousands of restaurants over the years. Too often Manhattan restaurants become complacent because of their locations and lose their respect for the customer.<br>With that being said I&#39;ve been coming to this restaurant since 2017. I use to come here everyday, one difference is I use to work corporate and wear slacks shirts &amp; ties. Now I&#39;m a government worker and wear more of a blue collar uniform. None of this should matter in America (Manhattan specifically) but in my opinion it does. \u00a0Firstly, I know the guys behind the grill they are great \u00a0(much better service than front of house) and I would tip them as they always went above and beyond to communicate and make sure I got what I wanted. For some reason I&#39;ve always felt a bit of impertinence from front of house but ignored it because it&#39;s something I&#39;m use to dealing with. <br>April 14, 2022 at approximately 10:30am I went to pickup an order I placed through seamless. I choose to pick my orders up and not eat at restaurants because I know the level of service I deserve and do not want to risk giving up on a place because of bad hospitality. Upon entry no one greets me. There&#39;s one guy with a chef jacket on he looks and I tell him I have a pickup order. He orders another employee to call for the meal. Again this guy never greets me and demeanor is very unwelcoming (which staff may get away with once in a while but managers should never be inhospitable in my opinion). I tell his runner my name and he brings up my food. I must say this, in my notes it clearly stated on receipt no olives in Greek salad I got olives next I put balsamic vinegar didn&#39;t get any dressing. I also called ahead to specify. I received my food and his runner left without worrying if my order was correct so the only one who was left the original guy with chef jacket. I asked for balsamic vinegar he turned his back and asked a lady behind the counter \u00a0who gave me balsamic vinaigrette. Now whether this was a rookie mistake or another language barrier I&#39;m not sure. So inform him this is balsamic vinaigrette and I want balsamic vinegar. He looks at me and tells me to tell the lady what I want and then turns his back on me. In the process of walking away he says next time make sure you put this in your order. This was insulting because not only did you get my order wrong I have to deal with this guy&#39;s attitude. So I responded &#34;I did put it in my order and asked did you read the paper.&#34; This guy turns around and tells me do not use that voice with me ( whatever that was supposed to mean). I then asked what is your name. He says what do you need my name for. I said I&#39;m not trying to argue with you what&#39;s your name. He then tells me to leave the store.<br>I again said fine just give me the vinegar. He then aggressively walks towards me with his chest out pointing and yelling &#34;get out now&#34;. I again repeated give me the vinegar and I will leave, the whole time vinegar is sitting behind counter. Now the lady behind counter intervenes and yells &#34;get out get out you&#39;re not wanted here&#34;. The manager then touches me and tries to push me. I turned around and told him if he touches me one more time I will attack back. At this point about 3-4 workers come from behind the counter like goons and try to force me out. The lady behind counter aggressively walks toward me yelling &#34;get out&#34; I then again say dont touch me and I will defend myself. Manager starts yelling trying to incite violence insisting I hit him.<br>Knowing this trap that certain types of people use, I then begin yelling &#34;hit me then&#34;. Manager then responded &#34;oh trust me I don&#39;t want to touch you&#34; receiving this kind of treatment for no good reason I responded you&#39;re a racist. Eventually they gave me my vinegar and I left. I have placed well over 30 orders since 2017. I never threatened them, I didn&#39;t damage any of their property, I didn&#39;t steal and I didn&#39;t touch any of them. Up until the manager refused to give me his name (which seems thuggish to me) after disrespecting me is when the back and forth started. I called their corporate office and gave them a chance to iron things out and it&#39;s been over a week they never responded. Mangia should hire me so I could show them how you&#39;re supposed to treat customers especially repeat customers. However, I would never wanna associate with a company that thinks it&#39;s okay for these type of people to manage their store. Last but not least I felt bad for those employees who felt they needed to come from behind the counter to stick up for their scum of a manager that instead of diffusing a situation chose to insight one.

Although, that description is not quite true, because as we realised a few bites in, we got a scoop of durian ice cream instead of vanilla. A bit of a dryly amusing mixup, since fortunately none of us were too upset with this, but I think it could have been problematic for others given how strong the durian smell is (I&#39;m that way with cilantro!).

I came here with SO to celebrate my birthday and we opted for the Tasting Menu. The executive chef spent 6 years at Le Cou Cou and it shows through how every sauce was to die for.<br><br>Oyster Manhatta - \u00a0This was quite a refreshing start to the tasting menu. I enjoy the addition of uni to add creaminess to the oyster. <br><br>Nantucket Bay Scallops - This was my second favorite course on the tasting menu because I am a huge fan of scallops and loved how they allowed the freshness of scallops to shine through. I love the coconut &#34;snow&#34; and meyer lemon that bought sweetness and tartness to liven the dish.<br><br>Tete De Cochon - This was an interesting dish and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Tete de Cochon translates to pig&#39;s head and this dish was a deep-fried terrine of pig&#39;s head and other herbs. It was a nice introduction to the savory dishes on the tasting menu. <br><br>Dover Sole - This was my favorite course because of how well-executed this it was. The dover sole was perfectly cooked and the seaweed beurre blanc was to die for. \u00a0I am still dreaming about this dish. <br><br>American Wagyu - I was slightly disappointed in this course because my cut of wagyu had a tendon/muscle, which made it hard to eat, but it was still well cooked and the sauce was awesome. I think if my cut of wagyu was more tender, it would have been an amazing dish.<br><br>Mochi - This was a nice palette cleanser for the savory mains. I am a huge lemon dessert so I enjoyed this, but it was a miss for my SO. \u00a0<br><br>Chocolate Sabyon - The perfect dessert to end this tasting menu. I love the decadence of the chocolate with hazelnut ice cream with the great balance of tartness from the passion fruit. <br><br>The stars of our meal were the cocktails. The drinks alone at Manhatta are worth a visit. Every cocktail was perfectly <br><br>IRISH KAP\u00c9 - This is Manhatta&#39;s version of espresso martini with notes of ube. This was my absolute favorite cocktail and an excellent end to the meal. <br><br>GOODBYE ROSES - A light floral cocktail that is a splendid start to the meal. This was my second favorite cocktail. <br><br>ESPRESSO MARTINI - The best espresso martini in NYC. I have had my fair share of espresso martini and this has the ideal combo of coffee and liquor with the perfect creaminess. Perfect nightcap! <br><br>DEEP FAKE NEGRONI - This is Manhatta&#39;s take on Negroni and even though I am not a whiskey fan, I liked this cocktail. <br><br>MANHATTA - Another stunning cocktail.<br><br>MISTAKES WERE MADE - This was the only miss for me, but it was also because all the other cocktails have just wowed us. This just missed the mark. <br><br>The staff here all go above and beyond to make your whole experience memorable.

I have lived in Gramercy / Murray Hill my whole life and have been eating Indian food here since Shaeen Sweets pioneered &#34;Curry Hill&#34; in about 1977. Have also been to India over ten times. I am vegetarian and like a lot of flavor and heat. <br><br>The first time we got dinner delivered from here it was an amazing experience. Both mine and my partner&#39;s meal were perfect. I started with the Vegetable Platter for $11.99, which was a great combination of one vegetable samosa, three onion pakora and some paneer pakora. For the entree I had Aloo Gobi at $16.99, which is my favorite standby at every India restaurant, and I compare. Probably the best Aloo Gobi I have had in Manhattan in twenty years. I asked for it to be hot and it was exactly the right amount of heat, reminded me of some great places in Mumbai. The samosa and pakoras were also perfect. That meal was five stars!<br><br>I am not going to delve into my girlfriend&#39;s meal, but she was extremely pleased also. And most important - the food is not served in a ridiculous amount of oil. Very little oil is key. Also of note, all the breads are very chewy. \u00a0<br><br>The second time was almost as perfect as the first... could be four and a half stars. Each time I am ordering the same thing. <br><br>But the third order, which was last Friday was very bad. the samosa and pakoras were fried way too long and were some of the lowest quality I have ever been served. It was very sad; I couldn&#39;t eat them. Then the Aloo Gobi was terrible, reeking of cinnamon as if the cook accidently poured cinnamon in it. The flavor was completely off, and it was only hot because of the vast amount of cinnamon. There were no chilies, and it was not really spicy, maybe it was medium hot, or maybe what they call &#34;American Medium&#34;. Also, the potatoes and cauliflower were very soft, and in general did not taste like it was fresh prepared. I have had plenty of inexpensive Indian buffet food in Philadelphia when I was at university there, and it was really like getting a late lunch when the buffet is closing and all that is left is very soft tasteless Aloo Gobi.

I guess some people would say, &#34;two out of three ain&#39;t bad&#34;, but not me. The average of a five star, and a four and a one is about three stars, which is very generous. <br><br>If it was up to me, I would never order from here again, but my girlfriend wants to give them one last chance.

Rudest service I have ever received. Although this rule is not displayed anywhere, each customer sitting at the table must order at least $17 worth of food. If my group and I had know \u00a0about this rule, we would not have come in and sat down as not all of us wanted to order anything and portions were big and able to be shared. We were slapped in the face with this rule as the couple who ran the store began yelling at us when we said we wanted to share a few plates instead of each ordering a meal. We were on a trip and on a budget, so we calmly responded that we were unaware of the rule (as no one had informed us) and sorry that we would not be able to dine here because of our budget. At this response, this grown woman, began screaming at us, a group of college students, claiming that it was unfair of us to use the restroom and sit in the restaurant to just leave. We were there for no more than ten minutes looking through the menu. I understood that she was upset as the business did lack in customers but this rule was listed NOWHERE as if they knew this would push customers away. if we had known, we would not have sat down. Even so, a business owner should not under any circumstances be yelling at her customers. There was only one other customer and without shame she yelled that we were taking advantage of her business and that we could not leave- she ordered that we had to order something. Against our will, we ordered a couple dishes. We ended up spending $56 for a meal that at most should have been $30. The food is incredibly overpriced and we were not able to enjoy it as we constantly felt pressure by the business owners who watched us. We also had a lot of food leftover because of the price restrictions which forced us to order an abundant amount of food. Under no circumstances should a business owner treat her customers this way.

I found fabulous, large avocados recently for $1 each, organic heirloom grape tomatoes for about $2.50 a pint. Five oz. clamshells of organic greens are usually about $3.50. <br><br>- The owners (or folks I presume to be owners) are charming and kind to human and canine pups. <br><br>- They stock a fun assortment of random, delicious products, ranging from good olive oil and halva and fresh dates in season, to teeny little Petit Suisse six-packs, well priced cheeses and milk, fresh bread, and (Dominican?) cakes and desserts. The store has a lot of wonderful little nooks and crannies to explore. <br><br>- I enjoy detouring on evening and weekend dog walks to stroll by and check out the sidewalk stand for beautiful, ripe tomatoes, a bag of clementines -- or just a giant 50 lb. pumpkin for a pittance around Halloween. <br><br>The one big damper on an otherwise lovely place are the often surly cashiers. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, there. They don&#39;t seem like deep-down mean people, but for whatever reason, these folks are not happy and that&#39;s reflected in how they interact with customers. Some take personal cell phone calls and ignore customers, despite the fact that the line is snaking out the door or around the corner.

Watch carefully: the cashier is ringing them up at $3.99/lb. For several years I thought that this practice was simple forgetfulness; after all, they&#39;re trying to work quickly, and it&#39;s hard to memorize prices for every item in the store. But recently I started questioning the prices, and the cashiers rolled their eyes and gave me the &#34;okay, you caught me&#34; look before making the correction. In one case, after I corrected a price, I had to get back in line for something I forgot, and I watched that same cashier charge the next customer the same inflated price. Clearly, this is not entirely accidental. They type so quickly, and the receipts they give are so vague that it&#39;s difficult to tell that this is going on unless you&#39;re watching like a hawk. But when you do... OUCH. I&#39;ve talked about this with my neighbors, who have now started noticing the same thing.
