Margherita Pizza - \u00a0a classic Italian staple - extremely good <br><br>5.Pepperoni pizza - Too salty that it&#39;s flavor \u00a0was lost in the saltiness \u00a0.<br><br>6. Mushroom pappardelle (plain and with chicken ) - worth the calories , as the sauce was to die for! <br><br>7.Shrimp scampi- \u00a0was the usual fare but the Shrimp was perfectly cooked .<br><br>8.Penne Vodka with Shrimp- was the best of all dishes we ordered . Yet again shrimp was perfectly cooked , juicy, \u00a0tender and had picked up the flavors of the sauce . <br><br>9.Truffle Caesar salad - I tried this like it was \u00a0going to be another basic Caesar Salad , but I was totally wrong .The truffle flavor changed the entire dynamics of this simple salad . It was unique &amp; tingled my taste buds . \u00a0<br><br>This place is a solid Italian neighborhood restaurant worth trying if you are in the area.

They offer both outdoor cafe seating and indoor seating. As I said, I felt like I was walking into a Roman Trattoria, with it&#39;s casual, rustic vibes -- booths, low lighting with Edison bulbs, pizza counter/oven in the back, tin ceilings and subway tile walls (OK so the latter two features are more New York, but I&#39;m not complaining). We opted to sit outside because it was a lovely night and not crowded out there.<br><br>I ordered a glass of Sangiovese, which arrived... off. As soon as I lifted the glass to take a sip, I knew it, but I tasted it anyway. And my husband&#39;s Stella arrived flat. I hate sending stuff back but at 14 bucks a glass of wine, I&#39;m not suffering through it. That said, they were very agreeable about taking things back.<br><br>I was pretty thrilled to see that I could get a vegan pizza that wasn&#39;t merely a marinara pie and it arrived LOADED with veggies and dollops of some kind of vegan cheese that I couldn&#39;t tell you the brand. It might be house made because it&#39;s the oddest vegan cheese that I&#39;ve ever had and I swear they put agave or some other sweetener on it. I don&#39;t like sweet on my pizza ever, but I was hungry and didn&#39;t want to send yet another item back (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever sent pizza back in my life, but this was just not good). I couldn&#39;t eat more than a couple slices because I truly didn&#39;t care for the flavor. Also it was loaded with raw red onion and bell pepper which I also do not like, but I should have specified when ordering to leave off these vegetables.<br><br>My husband liked his (some kind of meat with arugula) pie... I just think they need to tweak the vegan pizza and then they&#39;ll be golden.

It took a while for me to decide which protein to get. I wanted tripe but didn&#39;t see it so I tried a few fish balls and fish fillet. I went with mild again and it seemed consistent.

The price of these are high, so unless I am with a large party, I will likely avoid getting this again. It is an unnecessary expense that only makes your stomach bigger and your wallet thinner.<br><br>As for my ramen choice, I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle (always get extra noodle if you are given the option). The ramen comes out fast, and looks attractive. In general, ramen is a visually appealing dish, but this one looked splendid. It also is benefitted by the fact that Tonkotsu Ramen is known for its milky white broth due to the pork bones breaking down in the water for a significant amount of time; there is no milk in this broth at all. Speaking of pork, the pork chashu is beautifully cooked and not too dense, and the amount is perfect. The noodles are perfect, and they definitely taste fresh, in a milled out sort of way. Getting the extra noodles is also the right move because it is like getting two ramen bowls for the price of one; you get lots of noodles to keep your strength going - if you still have it.<br><br>If you still some reserves in the tank, make your way over to their sister sushi restaurant, Zest Sushi, only about a 10 minute walk from this restaurant. <br><br>My only complaint is the hours. They are open from noon until 4, then close for a half hour and reopen for dinner at 4:30. They then stay open until 10 or 11.

The Thai shrimp rolls were also good, but I would choose the fries over the rolls any day. Last, but certainly not least, the 249 roll. One of the best rolls I&#39;ve had!

OK, if I wanted it toasted, I could ask for that myself, as I do see TOASTED is an option on the menu board. \u00a0OK, I ordered, like this ... \u00a0Sesame bagel, scooped out with a lot of butter on it. \u00a0This is how it was... \u00a0Again, the bottom of the bagel was scooped out and that is where the butter was placed, \u00a0Into the scooped out part. \u00a0What ever was not scooped out was not buttered. \u00a0The top half of the bagel was not buttered at all. \u00a0BUT, there was a bit more butter than in my first experience, but hardly enough to warrant the cost and frankly to make it a good tasty bagel experience. \u00a0I pressed down on the top of the bagel, then turned it over and did the same thing in hopes that the butter would more evenly cover the bagel. \u00a0It didn&#39;t.<br><br>I could have mentioned all this each time or the first time to the counter person. \u00a0But I just figured, let&#39;s see 3 xs and then tell them, as in ask for a manager, or just let it go and not go back. \u00a0I&#39;m not going to go back there again.", "language": "en"}, "rating": 1}, {"photoCount": null, "reviewCount": 255, "eliteYear": null, "localizedDate": "12/30/2019", "comment": {"text": "Listen this place deserves nothing less than 5 stars.

I figured it was just that location and whoever made the sandwiches here and/or from management&#39;s direction.<br><br>Just recently was back at this location and they were worse than the Fulton one!! First I legit thought they had just given me a cream cheese bagel with no lox! I had to open it to check, and what I found was basically one sliver of lox and in the middle maybe a small piece thrown on. It also didn&#39;t look as fresh as normal. It looked &#34;off&#34;, like it was expired or close to it.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if they gave such little lox this time because this was older and they were running low or if they&#39;re just cutting back at all locations these days when making a &#34;traditional&#34;. I did have to run to the latrine soon after, after not having ate since the night before or all morning, so it&#39;s safe to say it was something I had here.

He did admit that it was his first day on the job which I understand - but I was disappointed about the things he could control, like being a warm and friendly person, smiling, being attentive like bringing water or bread to the table in a timely manner. When I asked him if there was any squid ink pasta on the menu, he looked like a deer in the headlights, asking me to repeat it twice. It was clear that he didn&#39;t know what squid ink pasta was. We ordered and as we waited for our bread, a different waiter changed our plates. Our completely unused plates. As he walked back to the waiter station, a different (I guess more experienced?) waitress began scolding him, &#34;Why did you change their plates? Go give them back!&#34; I was on her side, I didn&#39;t really understand why they were changing our plates when we hadn&#39;t touched or eaten anything yet. Then of course when our actual entrees came, no one changed our plates from appetizers to entrees. For the rest of our meal, the other more experienced waitress took over. We did tell them we were sharing everything and they insisted on portioning our food for us.. which I told them we were fine since I prefer to do it myself but she still lingered and felt the need to put two strands of linguini with clams ($27) on my plate for me after I had already served myself. <br><br>I would recommend maybe new waitstaff shadowing existing waitstaff or at least a more regimented orientation before setting them loose on customers, it was a bit unsettling and definitely affected our dinner vibe and experience.<br><br>A highlight of our meal was the lobster sauce special ($30), it came in a sealed foil wrap and the chef cut it open and poured it onto a new plate for us. That and the pizza were pretty good! The linguine with clams was a bit rubbery and tasted like plastic. All in all, a disappointing experience. I think the restaurant has gone through some changes through COVID and limited waitstaff, so I can&#39;t blame them for their circumstances.

The menu is severely limited - you could quite literally dine here alone, order the entire menu, and leave feeling empty as a victim of the Irish potato famine. The venue is half the size of my local dry cleaners, which speaks volumes. I would not recommend this for a date spot or even dinner with a friend; you&#39;re shoulder to shoulder with the party next to you and they will hear ever intimate detail of your conversation, as you must scream to overcome the blaring music.

Either way, I&#39;ll pass on the overpriced spicy rigatoni and leave it for the 17 year old influencers to Instagram.

This is a reservations-only, speakeasy kind of place, so remember to email ahead of time to secure a spot. My BF called the day of to surprise me before he left for a long trip overseas and was lucky enough to score some seats due to a cancellation; I was pretty excited to try another michelin star restaurant! The entire place probably only fits about 10-12 people, with a combination of tables and bar seats. There is only one waitress and one bartender from what I saw. <br><br>They have one menu with their cocktails on one side (all $20!), and food on the other. Along with that comes a teeny menu for oysters that you can mark up with a pencil (you can order them siberian style that comes with caviar, etc for $6 each). Here is what we got to share:<br><br>TOASTS (comes with 2)<br>Trout Roe - $22<br>What a sight! These two trout roe toasts were literally glistening in the candlelight. They overfill it, which is awesome, so each bite comes with a ton of flavor. You can really taste the ocean here without it being too salty. YUM.<br><br>Uni - $30<br>Not sure if it&#39;s because I&#39;m kind of uni-ed out (I still love it but now it&#39;s everywhere!), I wasn&#39;t HEAD OVER HEELS in love. Still, it was really good, and has a slightly different texture since it&#39;s on pretzel bread.<br><br>SEARED<br>Live scallop, sicilian pistachios, brown butter - $18<br>I really liked the toasty nutty brown butter taste, but felt like there was too much of it. Makes it a bit hard to taste the live scallop. Came on the half shell.<br><br>CRUDO<br>Saba mackerel, mint, radish - $29<br>Pretty good! The mackerel was less fishy than what I remember mackerel to taste like, which I enjoyed. The mint was a great pairing.<br><br>TARTARE<br>Baby yellowtail, golden beets, Vadouvan - $27<br>This dish was a standout, but I hated how little of it there was on a gigantic plate. I would&#39;ve preferred it to be colder too (this was more room temperature). At first, I totally hated on my BF for ordering this dish since it&#39;s just yellowtail tartare (which seems like something you can get at a japanese takeout), but the vadouvan indian spice is just genius and really made this dish unique. Not sure I&#39;ve ever tasted yellowtail like this before!<br><br>CARPACCIO<br>Chianina beef, sea urchin, caviar - $105<br>I mean, if we&#39;re only here once, might as well #YOLO and go all out, right? I&#39;m actually quite regretful that we got this dish (and I seriously hate saying that) since it&#39;s priced so ridiculously, and didn&#39;t meet my expectations. Perhaps it was too hyped up in my mind? The beef carpaccio, which takes up the entire plate, really needed seasoning (tastes like nothing unless you spread out the little blots of caviar. I would have wanted maybe sea salt?). Uni was good, caviar was good, and there was also a lot of lobster all over the dish even though it doesn&#39;t mention it on the menu. It&#39;s a lot of high quality good ingredients, but I&#39;m not sure it all came together. Comes with square pieces of toast, which were delicious by the way (haha easily impressed) - it tasted buttery and subtly sweet.<br><br>I reeeeaaallllyyyy wanted to get the buddha and coconut cocktails since they come in novelty &#34;glasses&#34;, but unfortunately the flavors didn&#39;t catch my eye. If I&#39;m going to spend $20 on a drink, I better like what&#39;s in it rather than what it looks like! <br><br>PEANUT BUTTER <br>Bourbon, pineapple, banana<br>AH this was pretty delicious and unique!!! When I ordered it, I had to get reassurance from the waitress that this wasn&#39;t too weird haha. The peanut butter really came through and smooothed out the bourbon. I think she mentioned that the bartender was from hawaii so he added this drink recently stemming from his influences from over there and this peanutbutter/coconut cream that he had found.<br><br>PEACH<br>Cognac, ginger, bitter apertif<br>Tropical drink - good but not as special. Good if you like fruity/beachy drinks!<br><br>PISTACCHIO<br>Gin, Honey, Cumquat<br>I thought this was pretty unique too. A little too sweet for my taste, but I love how I get to taste new flavors :) Love the smell of pistacchio too!<br><br>Some things I didn&#39;t like:<br>1. Price - I am totally willing to splurge on a good meal, but I felt like this was overpriced. Yes, it&#39;s all seafood and it tasted fresh, but it still doesn&#39;t justify the almost $200 bill per person.<br>2. Pace of meal - Dishes came out SO SLOWLY, which I totally do not understand.

Aside from having vaporized my 401K, ZZ&#39;s was worth every mother fucking penny. <br><br>Like pleasantries with some airy debutante, cocktail descriptions are more coy than descriptive. Allow me to translate; the &#39;pistachio&#39; was rich macha-green in color, sporting orange colored specs of nutmeg strewn atop a hefty micro-foam head pillowing protruding burgs of ice. A soft nutty-sweet flavor met homogenized pistachio oil unctuousness met balanced booziness. That&#39;s right, tonight it&#39;s a menage a trois. <br><br>The &#39;peat&#39; is down &#39;n brown boozy, almost entirely scotch. As I acclimated to its strength, the nuances revealed themselves. The &#39;peanut butter&#39; is what you&#39;d expect. With a burning cinnamon stick and served in a coconut, the &#39;coconut&#39; is a lavish affair, but a bit too syrupy-sweet, a bit too caustic-boozy, and not icey or refreshing enough for its context. <br><br>ZZ&#39;s doesn&#39;t lend itself to your assumptions, but if I had to make some, I&#39;d be most inclined to try the cuarcao, green tea, and peach cocktails next.

We just came directly from dinner at Blue Hill, and we just ordered four cocktails, not including the champagne we were served as we arrived, but we probably should try at least one of the dishes here, right? Wrong [shut up, Trump], we&#39;re having four and making America great again on our own terms. <br><br>Our whole life has lead us to this point. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the playground, sneaking a few extra gummy bear vitamins because they&#39;re actually candy, mangoes straight from the tree, homemade cranberry sauce with pomegranate reduction, citrus, and mint, McDonalds drunk at 1:45AM, still sizzling pork belly from the oven, ice cream for breakfast, sashimi tasting menus, a Snickers bar on the summit of some mountain in California -- all of it was for this. All I&#39;m saying is, if you start with the &#39;live scallop&#39; from the seared section, you&#39;re going to order more things. <br><br>The caramelized brown butter of the live scallop was reminiscent of the sweet sugar crust of creme brulee. The unique use of fried leeks in the sockeye salmon dish from the crudo section was delicious both in ways primal and metaphysical. The &#39;tuna, foie gras, bone marrow&#39; from the carpaccio section has also lead to the ruin that is now my life, but this dish probably could have done it single handedly; &#34;fuck, that&#39;s delicious&#34; doesn&#39;t really come close to my actual feelings but literarily I&#39;m at a loss. Honestly, I&#39;m not even emotionally equipped to describe it. The trout roe toast was great.

The ambiance is very cute plenty of plants, flowers, champagne fridge and plenty of places to take pics.

So we got 1 pitcher of white sangria which no one liked, 1 pitcher or red sangria which they didn&#39;t like much either and I chose Bebetela con passion which was very good we enjoyed it a lot. They put lots and lots of ice in each pitcher so this changes the taste if you drink slowly. Our server was very hard to get a hold of if we needed anything the staff were not accommodating and it took a while for things to come out. <br>For entree many people ordered different things off of the brunch menu there was really only 1 fish option so I got &#34;Tu salmon rosadito y fresquesito&#34; the salmon and vegetable which was average nothing special I ordered a side of rice along w this. I also asked for hot sauce of some kind and didn&#39;t get it right away I asked over and over again I stopped eating for a while waiting for it but my food started to get cold and it was brought basically when I was almost done w my food.

We were completely wowed and couldn&#39;t wait to come back in the warm months to see what the place looks like when it is fully open as a rooftop. <br><br>The food was a show. Completely delicious. <br><br>I don&#39;t give it five stars because the service was inconsistent and it lagged. They took a long time to take our orders and even longer to bring us a check, even though the food came out fast.

Off the elevator and three women behind a high table (not very welcoming btw) directed us in. And to our surprise, it looked and felt like we were in a restaurant in the tropics.

My experience here was very positive, from the food to the service. <br><br>This is a upper east Italian restaurant and I think sometimes it might get lost in the sea of other Italian places in the area.<br><br>Food: Everything we had at this restaurant was EXCELLENT. <br><br>The complimentary bread wasn&#39;t plain but actually well seasoned and the balsamic and oil that was given complemented it well. The bread also came out warm and soft. It definitely wasn&#39;t typical soda bread. <br><br>We ordered the bruschetta as our appetizer and it really stood out. The bread was perfectly toasted and I loved the way they had cut the tomatoes so we could actually enjoy the taste in each bite. The basil tasted fresh and my husband loves capers so he was very happy to see them added in the mix. <br><br>For the entree I got the risotto al porcini. It&#39;s been really hard to find good vegetarian mushroom risotto in NYC. This was probably one of the nicer mushroom risottos I&#39;ve had. The risotto wasn&#39;t overcooked which is huge because most places can&#39;t seem to get it right. <br><br>For dessert, we got the tiramisu. It was exactly what I&#39;d expect tiramisu to taste like. It didn&#39;t taste overly like coffee and it wasn&#39;t too sweet either. <br><br>Next time I want to try the zucchini fritti for sure as that looked very good on the menu. <br><br>Service: The waitstaff was quick and attentive. We were immediately seated and food came out very quickly. <br><br>Ambiance: I think it&#39;s an average looking restaurant. I do think they could add a little more to the decor if they want to stand out.

My favorites were the fish balls and fish tofu and my least favorite was the potato. I just wasn&#39;t a fan of the crunch of the potato. All of the skewers were the same spicy marinade and were served cold, which was a bit unusual. I also wish there were more traditional skewer options like chicken, beef or lamb. <br><br>The zha jiang mian was a very unique flavor, definitely not like any I&#39;ve had in the past. It was very nutty and a little spicy as well. I don&#39;t really feel like it fits the flavor profile for zha jiang mian but I thought it was delicious, nonetheless. <br><br>My friend ordered the spicy beef noodles and that was good as well, but I didn&#39;t like it as much as my dish. The highlight of the dish was the beef - it was extremely tender and absorbed all the flavors of the broth. I was just sad that it didn&#39;t come with more. <br><br>Overall, I would say that the dishes served here are pretty good. Only thing I would change would be to have more options.

The staff here is friendly and courteous even though they got a bit overwhelmed dealing with our massive table along with the other people in this small place. As someone who prefers this style of Thai food, the food here was really good. Honestly some of if not the best Thai food I&#39;ve had including Queens and they have steep competition from a lot of other places. In terms of a drink, they were out of coconut juice so I went with hibiscus juice which was tasty; not too sweet or sour. <br><br>The first dish that arrived was the Som Tum Thai Kai Kem or papaya salad/som tum with salted duck egg (15$.) The full description is shredded green papaya salad with salted duck egg, roasted peanuts, dried shrimp, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime, chilies, garlic, long bean, and tomato. This was a wonderful version of a papaya salad with a bit of spiciness and sweetness along with a good amount of saltiness from the duck egg. The fish sauce and chili bottom is recommended if you like a bit more heat.<br><br>The next dish was Goong Chae Num Pla or raw shrimp salad. (18$.) This consisted of shrimp marinated in fish sauce, chilies, and lime juice and it was served with bitter melon and mint leaves. This isn&#39;t for the faint of heart from but I loved it personally. <br><br>Another appetizer, the the Moo Ping or grilled pork skewer (10$ for 3 skewers) which was served with jaew (or Nam Jim Jaew,) a spicy dipping sauce. The pork was moist and the dipping sauce added some extra flavor. No complaints but not much to talk about though I do prefer the coconut marinated pork from Som Tum but that&#39;s a different dish so it&#39;s hard to compare directly.<br><br>A bunch of dishes arrived next including the Tum Kanoon or northern style jackfruit (18$.) This consisted of stir fried young jackfruit mashed with tomatoes, chilies, kaffir lime leaf, and topped with fried garlic and it was served with sticky rice, cucumber, and pork crackling. I have never had this before and I found to be very tasty. I usually find young jackfruit/ the savory version to be a very poor version of shredded pork but the texture and flavor here were outstanding. The garlic and the pork crackling added some extra texture. Very tasty dish.<br><br>Another dish that arrived was the Pad Phed or roast duck curry (24/26$ I believe. Broken listing on site.) Also known as Gaeng Phed Ped Yang, this consisted of said half duck with Thai eggplant, pickled peppercorns, bell pepper, basil, wild ginger, and spicy curry paste. I personally prefer many other curries but the duck was very well prepared so it&#39;s hard to make any complaints.<br><br>The second to last dish was the Yum Naem Kow Tod or crispy rice and soured pork sausage (15$.) This consisted of double fried rice croquettes with cured pork sausage, kaffir lime, ginger, chilies, mint, and roasted peanuts. Also known as Lao fried rice ball salad, this is a dish I have had before as well. Very nice mix of textures here from the crispy rice to the naem (aka the sour pork sausage I loved while in Chiang Mai.) Reasonably priced also.<br><br>The last dish that arrived was the Kow Soi Gai or Chiang Mai Chicken Curry Noodle (18$.) Also called Khao Soi Thai, this is a Thai dish with Muslim roots but there is also another dish with the same name that is completely different which is a bit less common. I personally love this dish and this was probably unfortunately the weakest of the food. Nice big portion of noodles as well as chicken but the version at Thep and a few other spots have a lot more flavor. I&#39;m surprised more because of how good everything else was but this was probably the only miss. Still perfectly tasty but I recommend other dishes more. <br><br>We decided to order dessert and there was a bit of miscommunication so it resulted in two orders of the following three deserts (just two extra which was fine as we were originally just getting the mango sticky rice and one of the other two dishes.)<br><br>Khao Niao Ma Muang or mango sticky rice (12$.) This was a tasty version especially with the added mung beans. The sticky rice was less sweet compared to most places and the mango was sweet. It&#39;s hard for me to not compared to the absurdly good mango in Thailand but this was a good take especially for a New York version.<br><br>I-Tim Kati or Thai coconut ice cream ($8.) This consisted of coconut ice cream with sweet sticky rice, toddy palm seeds, mung bean, jackfruit, coconut meat, and roasted peanuts. Fun tasty dessert but I preferred the other two but more because I just happen to tend to love the other two desserts in general. Perhaps add more jackfruit for flavor?<br><br>Kanom Tuay or Thai coconut custard. ($8 for 3 cups.) This consisted of rice flower, palm sugar and coconut milk and it is a steamed coconut custard. This is one of my favorite Thai desserts and it is a shame that usually you can&#39;t find it outside of in Queens outside of frozen.<br><br>Ran out of review room for the first time in ages.
